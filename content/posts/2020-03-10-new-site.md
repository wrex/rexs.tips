Time for a refresh.

I'm going to retire [the old site](https://lessons.doiwalters.com) and start using this site exclusively going forward. It should be faster, better on mobile, and easier for me to post new content and maintain the site.
<!--more-->

If you're curious about the technical details, I've decided on the following:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as the static site Generator.
* [LoveIt](https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/) as the theme for the site.
* [Hover](https://www.hover.com) for my domain registration.
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) as my CDN
* [Netlify](https://www.cloudflare.com) as my deployment platform

As always, this is as much about tinkering as anything.

One of my goals for the new site is to explore TDG: "test driven guitar" (a recent idea of mine).

I'm a believer in TDD (test driven development) and I think the idea may be applicable to learning guitar. Basically, the whole idea of TDD is to write tests **first** before writing any actual code. Then, when the tests pass, you know your done. Basically, it's a way to avoid moving goalposts and the temptation of "good enough".

I think it may be worthwhile to create a series of simple tests for myself (like progressing through the cycle of fourths and playing notes on all strings at 40 BPM). Then, if I maintain a list of "tests" and their associated pass/fail status, I can easily pick and choose what to work on during each day's practice session.

Pen and paper will initially suffice for tracking the current pass/fail state of each test, but it would be nice if the site itself could track it for each logged in user.

Of course, since the site is currently purely static html, this will require implementing some sort of stateful microservice. I'm currently leaning toward [Netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) and [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com).

Whee!
