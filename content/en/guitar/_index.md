### Target Audience

This course is for beginner and intermediate guitar students of a particular type: technical people with an engineer's practical, but inquisitive nature.

If you want to learn guitar, can't help asking *"why?"* constantly, and you read operator's manuals for pleasure, then this site is for you.

### Starting points

The *entire* [introduction]({{< ref "guitar/introduction" >}}) section is nothing but background information on how this site was constructed, documentation conventions, content organization, etc. Feel free to skip this material unless you need help falling asleep.

Please jump directly to [fundamentals]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals" >}}) if you just want to learn how to play.

Jump to [Rex's System]({{< ref "guitar/rexs-system" >}}) if you are just looking for something to practice.
