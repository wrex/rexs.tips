## Demonstration

{{< youtube "kcugYI4JjXQ" >}}

## Procedure

As always, this test proceeds in fourths, starting with the note B and proceeding through all seven natural notes (sharps and flats are optional).

For each note, perform the exercise once on the GBE strings, and then again on the DGB string set.

The test should be performed with quarter notes at 60BPM.

1. On the GBE string set:

  * Find the current note on the current string set as low on the neck as possible. Form the appropriate minor triad shape for a root note on that string.

  * Play that minor triad on the beat.

  * Move to the next note in the cycle nearby and play the appropriate triad for that root note. You should only need to move your hand one or two frets higher up the neck.

  * Continue up the neck until you've played all seven natural notes.

2. Repeat with all seven notes on the DGB string set.

3. Now play *four* note "triad" shapes as shown in the video. All the Bm, then all
   the Em, etc.

4. Finally, with your left hand positioned at the second fret, play Bm on the
   top four strings (the notes F&sharp;, B, D, and F&sharp;). Now play the
   closest Em shape on the next beat, then Am, Dm, etc. through the cycle of
   fourths. Use four note minor chord shapes on the top four strings throughout
   the exercise. It's easiest if you visualize the root note moving across the
   strings (your hand will move up the neck as you progress).


## Pass criteria

You can perform all three exercises with quarter notes at 60 BPM without any mistakes.

## Extra credit

Perform the exercise with all 12 notes of the chromatic scale in fourths.
