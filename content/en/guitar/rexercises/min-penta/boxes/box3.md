## Demonstration

## Procedure

This drill is about shape memorization, so can be performed rubato. Perform it
for all seven natural notes, progressing in fourths as usual.

For each root note:

1. This scale shape fits between two triad shapes. Play both minor chords on the
   top four strings.

2. Play all three root notes in the shape.

3. Practice going straight up and down the [box 3]({{< ref
   "guitar/blues/min-penta/box3#third" >}}) shape. Start and end on a root
   note. The first time through, play just the pentatonic notes. Then include
   the &flat;5.
   
4. Play sequences of three (as described in {{< tdgref
   "min-penta/pans/pan-connection-drills" >}}). Again, first just penatonic
   notes, then with the full blues scale.

5. Repeat using sequences of four (as described in {{< tdgref
   "min-penta/pans/pan-connection-drills" >}}). Pentatonics, then blues scale.

6. Finally, repeat by playing in thirds (as described in {{< tdgref
   "min-penta/pans/pan-connection-drills" >}}). This step should **only** use the
   pentatonic notes (don't include the &flat;5).

## Pass criteria

While the test may be performed rubato, you should be able to play in any key at
roughly a 120 BPM quarter-note tempo.
