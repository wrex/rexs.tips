## Demonstration

TODO

## Procedure

This exercise should be performed rubato in every natural key. You should
probably only attempt one or two keys the first few times you practice this
exercise (I recommend starting with Am).

1. Play the three minor triad shapes on the top four strings. Visualize how the
   box 1, 2, and 3 shapes sit within these three triad shapes.

2. First, play with pentatonic notes only:

  * Play the connected shapes in a serpentine manner: ascend from the lowest
    note of box 3 to the highest note in box 3, then descend through box 4, and
    finally ascend through box 5. 
   
   * You can either "bounce back" from this point, or continue for several
     iterations before reversing direction. Be sure to practice _both_
     directions (ascending and descending) of every box shape, however.

3. Repeat step 2, but this time add the blue note.

## Pass criteria

You can play the exercise confidently in all keys at roughly 120 BPM (quarter notes).
