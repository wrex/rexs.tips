## Demonstration

TODO

## Procedure

This drill is about shape memorization, so can be performed rubato. Perform it
for all seven natural notes, progressing in fourths as usual.

For each root note:

1. Play the major chord shape on the top four strings.

2. Play all three root notes in the shape.

3. Practice going straight up and down the [box 1]({{< ref
   "guitar/blues/min-penta/box1#root" >}}) shape. Start and end on the root
   note. The first time through, play just the pentatonic notes. Then include
   the &flat;5.
   
4. Play sequences of three (as described in {{< tdgref
   "min-penta/pans/pan-connection-drills" >}}). Again, first just penatonic
   notes, then with the full blues scale.

5. Repeat using sequences of four (as described in {{< tdgref
   "min-penta/pans/pan-connection-drills" >}}). Pentatonics, then blues scale.

6. Finally, repeat by playing in thirds (as described in {{< tdgref
   "min-penta/pans/pan-connection-drills" >}}). This step should **only** use the
   pentatonic notes (don't include the &flat;5).

## Pass criteria

While the test may be performed rubato, you should be able to play in any key at
roughly a 120 BPM quarter-note tempo.
