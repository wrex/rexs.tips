## Demonstration

{{< youtube "o1XkFdY2hiw" >}}

## Procedure

This exercise should be performed rubato in every natural key. You should
probably only attempt one or two keys the first few times you practice this
exercise (I recommend starting with C).

1. Play the three major triad shapes on the top four strings. Visualize how the
   box shapes sit within these three triad shapes.

2. Start with the box shape that sits lowest on the neck (you can ignore open
   strings for simplicity, and only play boxes that are fully fretted). For
   example, if you are practicing in the key of A, you'd start with box 1 at the
   second fret.

3. First, play with pentatonic notes only:

  * Play the connected shapes in a serpentine manner: ascend from the lowest note
   of first box to the highest, then descend through the next box, then ascend, etc.
   
   * You can either "bounce back" from this point, or continue for several
     iterations before reversing direction. Be sure to practice _both_
     directions (ascending and descending) of every box shape, however.

4. Repeat step 3, but this time add the blue note.

## Pass criteria

You can play the exercise confidently in all keys at roughly 120 BPM (quarter notes).
