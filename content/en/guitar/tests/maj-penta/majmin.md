## Demonstration

## Procedure

This is an exercise, not a proficiency test. There is no "passing".

Refer to the [minor]({{< ref
"guitar/blues/maj-penta#Am-frying-pan" >}}) and [major]({{< ref
"guitar/blues/maj-penta#major-frying-pan">}}) single octave frying pan shape
(one shape, two ways of thinking about it).

Find or record _two_ backing tracks: one with an Am drone, and another with a C
major drone (just simple slow strumming of open chords suffices).

Since the frying pan shape we're using is at the fifth fret, first identify the
C major and Am triad shapes on the top four strings. For C major, use
the [CAGED G shape]({{< ref
"guitar/Fundamentals/harmony/triads/FAD#CAGED-G">}}). For Am, use the top four
notes of the [Fm arpeggio shape]({{< ref
"guitar/Fundamentals/harmony/triads/minor#C-minor-arpeggios">}}) but at the
fifth fret.

First put on the the minor backing track and create some minor lines
with the frying pan as we've been doing. Emphasize the root note (A)
to get the minor sound in your ear. Find a simple three or four note lick that
you like (one that ends on the root note).

Now put on the C major backing track and repeat the exercise. First try playing
_the exact same lick_ you just performed. It probably doesn't sound as good. Not
wrong exactly, but ... a little off somehow.

Next, create some new _major_ licks that emphasize and end on the major triad
notes of C, E, and G (root, M3, and P5). **That** is the sound of the major
pentatonic. Same collection of notes, but a completely different sound just by
emphasizing different notes!

Spend some time switching back and forth between minor and major licks over both
backing tracks. Both can work over either chord, but you should start hearing
the different chord tones in the backing track, and automatically start
emphasizing those sounds for a more consonant solo.
