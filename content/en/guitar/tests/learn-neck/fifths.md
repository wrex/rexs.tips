## Procedure

This one is also pretty easy, but trickier than fourths.

Instead of going clockwise around the clock, we are going to practice moving in fifths by moving *counter*-clockwise.

Practice saying the full 12 note cycle of fifths *out loud* a few times, starting at F: F G C D A E B G&flat; D&flat; A&flat; E&flat; B&flat;. Keep looping around from B&flat; to F and continue the cycle.

Once you are bored with that practice starting on different notes within the sequence and continuing backward around the "clock" (without looking at the image above of course!). Starting at C, for example, say *out loud* "D A E B G&flat; D&flat; ...."

## Pass criteria

1. You can answer any of the following *effortlessly*:
    * What's a perfect fifth above D? (I.e. what's before D on the "clock"?)
    * What's a perfect fifth above A&flat;?

2. You can start on any of the 12 notes and effortlessly recite the cycle of fifths starting on that note.
