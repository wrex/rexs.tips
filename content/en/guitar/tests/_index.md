My system for practicing continues to evolve. I'm trying to make it as simple
as possible (and no simpler, to paraphrase Einstein).

This page explains how to _use_ the system. Please see [how to practice]({{< ref
"guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice" >}}) for the motivation behind the
system.

Everybody's "practice" sessions usually comprise short bursts
of true, focused _practice_ interspersed with bits of noodling/playing, getting
coffee, searching for something you saw online, etc. 

The system described here tracks individual, focused, "_exercise-sessions_."
Each exercise-session a short, focused burst of effort, typically five to twenty
minutes long. You'll often work through more than one during a single day's
practice. 

Don't feel bad about in-between time spent noodling and goofing around. It's
important to enjoy your practice time, and you _need_ recovery time between
practice sessions. There is no point in _tracking_ "between" time, though.

## The rules

**Rule 1:** Practice what you want.

**Rule 2:** Track and review what you practice.

**Rule 3:** Never work on more than 5 things at a time.

## The components

The system is comprised of:

* A `practice area`

* An `exercise library`

* A `focus list`

* A ring of `Zettelkasten cards` with one or more cards for each `exercise session`

Each of these is described in more detail below.

## Preparation

1. Create a dedicated practice area. Make it as distraction-free as possible.
   The corner of a room suffices, but everything you need should always be out
   and ready to go. Make it as comfortable as possible, so that it's _someplace
   you want to be_.
   
   You'll need:

   * your guitar
   * a calendar
   * a kitchen timer
   * a metronome
   * some way to _easily_ record yourself (a smart phone is perfect)
   * a multi-colored pen and your Zettelkasten cards (see below)

   Phone apps work for the timer and metronome, but dedicated hardware is better
   (switching between apps on your phone can be distracting, and sometimes you
   want to record yourself _with_ a metronome).

2. Create an `exercise library` of proficiency-tests/drills/exercises (or simply
   use the one provided in this chapter). Each drill in the library should
   include complete documentation on how to perform the exercise, proficiency
   criteria, examples, etc. More on this below.

3. Create a
   [Zettelkasten](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1)
   ring of index cards to track your `excercise-sessions` (one card per
   exercise-session). We are using a modified version of the general
   Zettelkasten note-taking system. 
   
   You'll need a few inexpensive office supplies:

   * [Blank 3x5 index cards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X5CSNVH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
   * [Colored 3x5 index
     cards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XSXXKFZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
     to use as separators. You may want to use [plastic
     separators](https://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Index-Inches-Assorted-Colors/dp/B0000AQOET/ref=sr_1_1)
     instead.
   * [A set of binder
     rings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081YXSV89/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
     to hold your cards.
   * [A single hole
     punch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XP9CPWQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
   * [A multi-colored pen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ODR688E/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s001)

4. Write down a list of one to five things that you want to practice for the
   next several days, weeks or months. This is your `focus list`.

   Print your focus list on one of the colored cards and place it at the front
   of your Zettelkasten ring. Place 20 to 50 blank white cards behind it on the ring
   (add more cards as you need them).
   
   You may replace any item on your `focus list` whenever you want, but never
   allow yourself more than 5 things on the list (fewer is even better).
   
   The `focus list` accomplishes three things:
   
   * You'll never stop practicing something without a _conscious_ decision
     (as opposed to forgetting about it because you were distracted by something
     else).
   * You'll never be at a loss for _what_ to practice.
   * You'll never feel overwhelmed because you're studying too many things at
     once. If you're working with a teacher, don't be afraid to tell him or her
     that you _don't_ want to work on something new because your focus
     list is full!

## The concept

Basically, the `focus list` contains up to five drills from your `exercise
library`. Your `exercise library` is your master list of exercises: everything you might ever want to practice.
Think of the process like checking out items from your library: you're only
allowed to check out up to five items at a time. Each drill in your library has
an ID (sort of like an ISBN number).

Your `Zettelkasten cards` track each time you practice an individual drill.
Since over time you'll be adding exercises to your library, and items will come
and go on your `focus list`, considerable time may elapse between `exercise
sessions` for the same drill. 

The purpose of the `Zettelkasten cards` is to keep
your notes as organized as possible (and close together on the ring).

## The process 

1. Select an item from your `focus list` to practice.

2. If you've never practiced the exercise before, create a new card for the
   item, otherwise find the card for the prior session and review your notes.
   Most days you'll only work on one to three exercises.

3. Practice the exercise, taking note of the time you spend on it (either via wall-clock
   time, or, better, by using your kitchen timer).

4. When you finish the exercise, annotate the appropriate card with the
   date and the amount of time you spent practicing. It can be fun to
   track cumulative minutes, too.

5. Write down any thoughts you have about the exercise. Think of things you
   might want to review next time: Do you feel you're improving? Struggling?
   Anything to focus on particularly? What metronome settings did you use? Which
   chords/keys/sections/etc. did you practice? Did you leave off in the middle,
   or is there someplace you want to pick up next time?
   
6. Repeat with the next exercise you want to practice, or quit for the day if
   you're energy is running low.

### About the exercise library

The exercise library contains _everything_ you might ever want to practice. It
will grow without bound, so we want to make it easy to add (and _insert_)
exercises to the library whenever we want.

Every exercise/drill/proficiency-test has a **short** ID you can use to
reference it from your Zettelkasten cards. Writing out long titles gets old in
a hurry.

Exercises are often _hierarchical_. It's common, for example, to have a master
proficiency test (like "demonstrate fretboard note-location proficiency") with
several sub-drills or sub-sub drills (like "find natural notes on the E string"
or "practice finding notes with octave shapes"). Exercise IDs use the
Zettelkasten naming style. For example, RT9, RT9a, RT9b, RT9C, RT9C1, RT9C1a,
RT9C1b, RT9C2, RT9D, RT10, etc.

This site contains **my** master list of drills, and you're welcome to use it,
but you should also maintain _your own_ library of exercises as well. All of my
exercise IDs are prefixed "RT".

A simple bound notebook with a new page for each exercise suffices for your own
library, but if you're at all technically inclined, I **highly** recommend an
online library, since you'll almost certainly want to reference
videos, images, tabs/sheet-music, and other media.

My strong recommendation is
[markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)
files on [ github ](https://github.com) using
[github-pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

[Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)
allows you to link to videos, diagrams, tabs, etc. as required.
[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) and [github](https://github.com) make version
control and backup simple and automatic.
[Github-pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
makes it trivial to publish your library on the internet if you so desire.

One note about IDs: don't worry too much about getting them right, and avoid the
temptation to change any existing exercise's ID. It's just a label in the end,
and it doesn't matter that much if things aren't perfectly ordered. You can
always reference one exercise from any other.

## More about The Rules

### Rule 1. Practice what you want

At the risk of stating the obvious: if you hate to practice, then eventually you
_won't_ practice. Full stop.

Ideally, practice should be at least somewhat enjoyable, but keep the following in mind:

- There is no point in practicing what you've already mastered. Warm-up drills
  and some technique exercises are an exception.

- If what you're practicing is too hard, you'll hate practicing. If something is
  too difficult, break it into smaller chunks and practice those in turn,
  building up to the full exercise. It's best to take baby steps.

- Try to balance the six T's: training (general/mixed topics), theory,
  technique, tones (ear training), tunes, and timing. This isn't necessary every
  session, but strive for balance over the long haul.

- Remember that _you play what you practice._ The way you practice scales,
  triads, etc. will show up in your playing eventually. If you only practice
  scales by mechanically going up and down the scale linearly with a monotonous
  rhythm, guess how your solos will sound? Try to be musical with
  your practice. (This is why almost all my exercises proceed in
  fourths, by the way.)

### Rule 2. Track what you practice

The simple act of writing down what you're working on helps you focus.

It's motivational to track how much _time_ you spend practicing. A kitchen timer
will keep you honest.

**Use a metronome**. A metronome helps not only to build speed, but also to
measure progress. Remember that you can use whole notes, half notes, quarter
notes, triplets, and sixteenth notes in addition to adjusting the BPM!

**Record yourself**. Objectively listening to yourself is a million times easier
if you _aren't currently focused on playing_. Get in the habit of recording
yourself often. Go back and listen to old recordings periodically, too.

### Rule 3. Never work on more than five things at a time

Three things at a time is even better (but hard to stick to).

Your `focus list` should change slowly, certainly no more than every several
days. If you're tired of working on something, feel free to swap it out for
anything else that interests you, but **nothing feels better than taking
something off the list because you've already mastered it**. Persistence is a virtue.
