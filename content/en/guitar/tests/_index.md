Fair warning: the system described here is still quite new. It's still in flux and
somewhat aspirational (as of May, 2020). I've **not** yet used it long enough to
create real-world examples, and some rough edges are bound to remain. Your
mileage may vary.

## Introduction

This page documents my personal (and evolving) practice system.

Don't let the length of this document fool you. The system isn't _at all_
complicated.

I've learned the hard way that I'll give up on any system that isn't dirt
simple.

My system mostly depends on just two things:

1. A continually growing library of individual exercises stored on a computer
   (mine is [published here]({{< ref "guitar/tests/compact-test-listing" >}})).

2. A collection of hand-written index cards for reviewing and taking notes
   during a practice session. 

One note card in particular contains my `focus list` containing the five
or fewer exercises I plan to focus on over the coming days or weeks.

I've tried various apps to track my practice, but I've found I **strongly**
prefer a pen and paper to take notes during practice. 

For some reason, scribbling something with a pen seems far less intrusive and
distracting than typing on my phone or on a computer. A pen requires far less of
a [context switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

I want to avoid a computer keyboard if at all possible _while practicing_, but
my exercise _documentation_ must link to videos, audio files, neck diagrams,
tablature/notation, _etc._

My solution is to maintain an exercise library on my computer, but use hand-written notes
on index cards while practicing. The notes refer back to exercises in the
library.

I rarely need to refer to the online documentation for a particular exercise
after practicing it the first time.

[Josh](mailto:josh@fretboardanatomy.com) over at [Fretboard
Anatomy](https://fretboardanatomy.com) gave me most of the ideas that led to
this system. In particular, many of the exercises documented here are slightly
modified versions of drills that he taught me. He also turned me on to the
[Zettelkasten](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1)
system of note-taking.
{{< /alert >}}

## The rules

**Rule 1:** Practice what you want.

**Rule 2:** Track and review what you practice.

**Rule 3:** Never work on more than 5 things at a time.

#### Practice what you want

At the risk of stating the obvious: if you hate to practice, then eventually you
_won't_. Full stop.

Practice should be at least somewhat enjoyable, but keep the following in mind:

- If practice is too hard, you'll hate practicing. If it's too easy you won't
  make progress. You must push yourself without becoming demotivated (finding
  that balance point is tricky).

- There is no point in practicing what you've already mastered _except_ for
  "mindless" warm-up drills and technique exercises. Some days I only have
  energy for "mindless" exercises.

- I try to balance the six T's: training (general/mixed topics), timing, tunes
  (repertoire), theory, technique, and tones (ear training). This isn't
  necessary every session, but strive for balance over the long haul.

- Remember that _you play what you practice._ The way you practice scales,
  triads, etc. will show up in your playing eventually. If you only practice
  scales by mechanically going up and down the scale linearly with a monotonous
  rhythm, guess how your solos will sound? If you permit fret buzzes and muted
  notes when playing chords during practice, they won't magically fix themselves
  when performing.
  
  Try to be musical with your practice. 

#### Track what you practice

The simple act of writing down what you're working on helps you focus.

It's motivational to track how much _time_ you spend practicing as well as
tracking streaks (continuous days with at least one exercise practiced).

A kitchen timer will keep you honest about time. 

Track streaks by marking a big
red X on a wall-calendar (or with an app like
[strides](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strides-goals-habits-tracker/id672401817)
on iOS or
[loop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_US)
on Android).

**Use a metronome**. A metronome helps to not only build speed, but also to
measure progress. Remember you can use whole notes, half notes, quarter
notes, triplets, and sixteenth notes in addition to adjusting BPM!

**Record yourself**. Objectively listening to yourself is a million times easier
if you _aren't currently focused on playing_. Get in the habit of recording
yourself often. Go back and listen to old recordings periodically, too.

#### Never work on more than five things at a time

Three things at a time is even better (but hard to stick to).

Your `focus list` should change slowly, certainly no more than every several
days. If you're tired of working on something, feel free to swap it out for
anything else that interests you, but nothing feels better than taking
something off the list because you've already mastered it.

Persistence is a virtue!

## Practice vs. exercise sessions

My practice sessions are typically thirty to ninety minutes long on any given
day. I aspire to daily practice, but sadly miss days on occasion.

Like most people, my "practice" sessions usually comprise a few short bursts of
true, focused _practice_ interspersed with bits of noodling/playing, trying to
find my blasted tuner or favorite pick, getting coffee, searching for something
I just saw online, _etc_.

The system described here tracks these individual, focused,
"exercise-sessions" _within_ a day's practice, not the total wall-clock time I
spent in my practice area.

Each exercise-session is a short, focused burst of effort, typically just three to five
minutes long. I'll often work through more than one during a single day's
practice.

Don't feel bad about time spent noodling and goofing around! Every
minute you spend with a guitar in hand helps. It's important to enjoy your
practice time, and we _need_ recovery time between exercise-sessions. It's
impossible to sustain the intense focus required by real _practice_ for more
than a few minutes at a time.

## Shopping list

You've probably got most of what you need already on hand, but here's the
complete list of things you'll need to implement this system. The items I've
linked to are just examples, not recommendations.

* Some way to _easily_ record yourself. Audio only recordings suffice, but
  videos are even better. You'll need:
    * a [tripod](https://www.amazon.com/UBeesize-Phone-Tripod-Wireless-Compatible/dp/B07837W5NX/ref=sxin_9_ac_d_pm) and [holder](https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Adapter-Adjustable-Compatible-Camcorder/dp/B07SQ8TQT9/ref=sr_1_4) for your phone or camera
    * (completely optional) a [GoPro](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Hero5-Black-E-Commerce-Packaging/dp/B01MT0TJOM/ref=sr_1_3) or the like
    * (completely optional) a decent mic and way to connect it to your
      computer/tablet/phone
    * (completely optional) a DAW of some sort.
* A [guitar
  stand](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Folding-Acoustic-Electric-Guitars/dp/B018FCZKR2/ref=sr_1_3)
  so your guitar is always out of it's case and ready to go.
* A [tuner](https://www.amazon.com/Snark-SN5X-Guitar-Violin-Current/dp/B01H74YV56/ref=sr_1_5)
* A wall calendar and clock
* A [kitchen timer](https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Timer-Digital-Countdown-Stopwatch/dp/B07D3BFY6R/ref=sr_1_5)
* A [metronome](https://www.amazon.com/SEIKO-SQ50V-SQ50-V-Quartz-Metronome/dp/B000LFCXL8/ref=sr_1_5)
* [Blank 3x5 index cards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X5CSNVH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
* [Colored 3x5 index
  cards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XSXXKFZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
  to use as separators.
* [A set of binder
  rings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081YXSV89/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
  to hold your cards.
* [A single hole
  punch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XP9CPWQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
* [A multi-colored
  pen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ODR688E/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s001)

## The system

### Components

The system comprises:

* A [practice area](#practice-area)

* An [exercise library](#exercise-library)

* A ring or box of note cards, your
  ([Zettelkasten](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1))
  with one or more notes for each "exercise-session"

* One special Zettel, your [focus list](#focus-list)

### Practice area

Create a dedicated `practice area.` Make it as distraction-free as possible. The
corner of a room suffices, but everything you need should always be out and
ready to go. Make it as comfortable as possible, so that it's _someplace you
want to be_.
  
Phone apps work for the timer and metronome, but dedicated hardware is better
(switching between apps on your phone can be distracting, and sometimes you
want to record yourself _with_ a metronome).

I like to have both a wall calendar and a clock visible at a glance (though again, your phone
suffices).

### Zettelkasten

The [history of Zettelkasten](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542866502/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_dcHWEbCA4024P)
is fascinating. A _ridiculously_ prolific sociologist (58 books and hundreds of
articles, many classics in their field) named Niklas Luhman developed the system.

Luhman created a lifelong note-taking system for academics. _Zettel_ apparently
means "note" in German, and _Kasten_ means "box". _Zettelkasten_ is just a
teutonically prescriptive way to take notes. It allows you to keep related notes
close together and organized in hierarchies. I found this [summary of how to use
Zettelkasten](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1)
quite helpful.

I just want to make my guitar practice as efficient as possible, but many of
Luhman's ideas seem directly applicable. 

Luhman's system appeals to me expressly _because_ it only uses handwritten notes
on simple index cards. I also like the smaller form factor of cards-on-a-ring over a
notebook (it's easier to throw in a gig bag!).

{{< alert color="info" >}}
I'm unsure yet if I prefer a ring or a box. The most important thing is that you
are able to easily re-order cards within your Zettelkasten.
{{< /alert >}}

As I mentioned above, I'm leery of touching the computer during practice: I
_know_ that once I put down my guitar and start typing on a computer or phone, I'm
doomed. It could be minutes, hours, or literally days until I get back to the
guitar.

My Zettelkasten is organized as follows:

1. One colored card at the very front contains my `focus list` (the five or fewer exercises I'm currently
  practicing). This card has id "1".
2. That's followed by card "2": my practice history. Every day I practice, I add
   a line with the date and references (id links) to my other practice notes.
   When I run out of room I continue onto other cards (2a, 2b, ..., 2aa, 2ab,
   ..., 2zzz).
3. Next is a section with all my sorted notes from previous practice sessions.
4. That's followed by a colored divider card.
5. Then comes several _unsorted_ note cards from recent sessions.
5. Lastly, I try to keep at least 20 blank cards at the end for new
   notes.

As suggested by [abramdemski](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/abramdemski) I use
the section of unsorted cards as a sort of recency buffer. Unsorted cards are
things I've recently worked on. Eventually, I sort them to the front.
  
Note that my Zettels are numbered differently than exercises. I use the ID prefix
"RT" for items in my `exercise library`, but cards in my Zettelkasten have no
prefix: they all start with a number.

Zettels can refer to other Zettels as well as to exercises from the library.
Because of the RT prefix, I can tell at a glance what a note is referring to.

### Focus list

The `focus list` contains a list of one to five exercises that I want to practice for the next
several days, weeks or months.

The `focus list` is always at the very front of my _Zettelkasten_. 

### Process 

1. Select an item from your `focus list` to practice.

2. If you've never practiced the exercise before, create a new card for the
   item, otherwise find the card for the most recent session and review your notes.
   Most days you'll only work on one to three exercises.

3. Practice the exercise.

4. When you finish, annotate the appropriate card with the date, the amount of
   time you spent practicing, and any other notes you think might be worthwhile.
   You may want to track cumulative minutes in addition to the time on this
   individual `exercise-session`.
   
   Write down any thoughts you have about the exercise. Think of things you
   might want to review next time: 
   
   * Do you feel you're improving? Struggling?
   * Anything to focus on particularly? Was there any movement/section/fingering that was
     particularly difficult? Did you forget something in the middle?
   * What metronome settings did you use? 
   * Which chords/keys/sections/etc. did you practice? 
   * If you didn't complete the exercise, is there someplace you want to pick up next time?
   
6. Repeat with the next exercise you want to practice, or quit for the day if
   you're energy is running low.

## The exercise library

Create an `exercise library` of proficiency-tests/drills/exercises (or simply
use the one provided here). Each drill in the library should include complete
documentation on how to perform the exercise, proficiency criteria, examples,
etc. More on this below.

The `exercise library` contains _everything_ you might ever want to practice.
You should try to create new exercises whenever you stumble across something
interesting in a book, magazine, online course, video, or even a conversation
with a band-mate.

The library will grow without bound, so it must be easy to add (and
_insert_) exercises to the library whenever we want.

Every exercise/drill/proficiency-test must have a **short** ID you can use to
reference it from your Zettelkasten cards. Writing out long titles gets old in
a hurry.

Exercises are often _hierarchical_. It's common, for example, to have a master
proficiency test (like "demonstrate fretboard note-location proficiency") with
several sub-drills or sub-sub drills (like "find natural notes on the E string"
or "practice finding notes with octave shapes").

I recommend a `Zettelkasten` naming style for IDs, e.g.: ..., RT9, RT9a, RT9b,
RT9C, RT9C1, RT9C1a, RT9C1b, RT9C2, RT9D, RT10, etc. This allows easy insertion
of new drills into an existing hierarchy while still keeping similar drills
close together.

This site contains **my** master list of drills, and you're welcome to use it,
but you should also maintain _your own_ library of exercises as well. All of my
exercise IDs are prefixed "RT". The exercises in your library (or anyone else's
that you chose to use) should be prefixed with one or two different letters.

A simple bound notebook with a new page for each exercise suffices for your own
library, but if you're at all technically inclined, I **highly** recommend an
electronic library, since you'll almost certainly want to link to
videos, images, tabs/sheet-music, and other media.

A folder of Microsoft Word or Google Docs documents will work.

My strong recommendation is to use
[markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)
files on [ github ](https://github.com) with 
[github-pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

[Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)
allows you to easily link to videos, diagrams, tabs, etc. as required without
losing focus on the content you're creating.
[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) and [github](https://github.com) make version
control and backup simple and automatic.
[Github-pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
makes it trivial to publish your library on the internet if you so desire.

One note about IDs: don't worry too much about getting them right, and avoid the
temptation to change any existing exercise's ID. It's just a label in the end,
and it doesn't matter that much if things aren't perfectly ordered. 

Note that you can always reference (link to) one exercise from any other, as
well as from any _Zettel_.

## The focus list

The five items on your `focus list` should be _exercises_ that you can complete
within a single practice session. That doesn't mean you shouldn't have higher
level goals on your focus list! 

I use longer-term goals as headings/categories on my `focus list` with
individual exercises below each heading. For example, I currently want to focus
on _timing_ and _tunes_ over the long haul, so I've currently got two items
under the "timing" header, and one under "tunes".

I change out the items under a given heading much more frequently than I change
the headings themselves, but I _never have more than five exercises on the list
at a time._

**You may replace any item on your `focus list` whenever you want,** but never
allow yourself more than 5 things on the list (fewer is even better).

The `focus list` accomplishes three things:

* You'll never stop practicing something without a _conscious_ decision
  (as opposed to forgetting about it because you were distracted by something
  else).
* You'll never be at a loss for _what_ to practice.
* You'll never feel overwhelmed because you're studying too many things at
  once. If you're working with a teacher, don't be afraid to tell him or her
  that you _don't_ want to work on something new because your focus
  list is full!


## The Zettelkasten

I don't want to be _too_ prescriptive since I'm figuring this out for myself as
well, but I don't want to leave everything open ended. Here are my thoughts on
the layout of each individual _Zettel_ (note card):

1. Use "portrait" orientation. This will force you to write smaller and avoid
   being too verbose. Remember that you can _always_ continue onto another card,
   however! Only write on one side of the cards.

2. Decide ahead of time how you will use color. I've decided on the following:

   * BLACK: most content
   * Green: IDs and links to things not on the card
   * Blue: metadata or secondary information
   * RED: errors, warnings, and corrections

3. Every card gets a unique id (e.g. 2b, 3c1, or 4h19b3 for a particularly deep
   and wide hierarchy). 
   
   * Write each card's own ID in the upper right-hand corner (in green).

   * Create new cards (with new IDs) whenever you practice a new exercise (or
     want to take a note on something unrelated to any particular exercise).

   * Be sure to write at least the ID of the exercise you're practicing
     somewhere on the card (in green). You may want to include a few words from
     the title or description as well.

   * To add cards to an existing topic, create a new card with an ID one level
     lower. For example, if I'd previously created a card with ID "19" to
     practice exercise "RT4b3", but ran out of room while writing notes, I'd
     continue my thoughts onto a new blank card, and label it "RT4b3a".

   * Link to other cards whenever you want by writing the ID for that card in
     green.

   * If you continue a thought or make a connection onto another card, 
     link the cards bi-directionally: At the very bottom of the first card, write
     "cont." (or an arrow) followed by the ID of the new card. On the new card,
     write the prior card's id in the upper _left_ corner: (e.g. "see RT4b3").
     Again, links and IDs should be in green.

The _Zettelkasten_ itself has four sections. In order: `focus list`, sorted
cards, unsorted cards, and finally blank cards.

Always take notes on TODO
