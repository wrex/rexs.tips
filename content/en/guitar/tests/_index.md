## Background

My system for practicing continues to evolve. I'm trying to make it as simple
as possible (and no simpler, to paraphrase Einstein). In particular, I strongly
prefer a pen and paper for taking notes during practice, and want to avoid a
computer keyboard if at all possible (far too much opportunity for distraction).

[Josh](mailto:josh@fretboardanatomy.com) over at [Fretboard
Anatomy](https://fretboardanatomy.com) gave me some great ideas recently that
have utterly transformed my practice system. He turned me on to the
[Zettelkasten](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1)
system of note-taking.

This page explains how to _use_ the system. Please see [how to practice]({{< ref
"guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice" >}}) for the motivation behind the
system.

Note that in the real world, _everybody's_ "practice" sessions usually comprise short bursts
of true, focused _practice_ interspersed with bits of noodling/playing, getting
coffee, searching for something you saw online, etc. 

The system described here tracks individual, focused, "_exercise-sessions_."
Each exercise-session a short, focused burst of effort, typically five to twenty
minutes long. You'll often work through more than one during a single day's
practice. 

Don't feel bad about in-between time spent noodling and goofing around, though. It's
important to enjoy your practice time, and you _need_ recovery time between
practice sessions. But there is absolutely no point in tracking "between" time.

## The rules

**Rule 1:** Practice what you want.

**Rule 2:** Track and review what you practice.

**Rule 3:** Never work on more than 5 things at a time.

## The components

The system comprises:

* A `practice area`

* An `exercise library`

* A `focus list`

* A ring or box of note cards
  ([Zettels](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1))
  with one or more notes for each `exercise session`

The history of
[Zettelkasten](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542866502/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_dcHWEbCA4024P)
is fascinating. A _ridiculously_ prolific sociologist (58 books and hundreds of
articles, many classics in their field) named Niklas Luhman developed the system.

Luhman created a lifelong note-taking system for academics. _Zettel_ apparently
means "note" in German, and _Kasten_ means "box". _Zettelkasten_ is just a
teutonically pragmatic way to take notes. It allows you to keep related notes
close together and organized in hierarchies.

I just want to make my guitar practice as efficient as possible, but many of
Luhman's ideas seem directly applicable.

I'm leery of computer apps for note taking during practice: I
_know_ that once I put down my guitar and start typing on a computer or phone, I'm
doomed. It could be minutes, hours, or literally days until I get back to the
guitar.

Luhman's system appeals to me _expressly_ because it only uses handwritten notes
on simple index cards.

I want to be clear, however, that the system described here is still somewhat in flux and
somewhat aspirational (as of May, 2020). I've **not** yet used it long enough to
create real-world examples, and some rough edges are bound to remain.

## Preparation

1. Create a dedicated `practice area`. Make it as distraction-free as possible.
   The corner of a room suffices, but everything you need should always be out
   and ready to go. Make it as comfortable as possible, so that it's _someplace
   you want to be_.
   
   You'll need:

   * your guitar
   * a calendar
   * a kitchen timer
   * a metronome
   * some way to _easily_ record yourself (a smart phone is perfect)
   * a multi-colored pen and your Zettelkasten cards (see below)

   Phone apps work for the timer and metronome, but dedicated hardware is better
   (switching between apps on your phone can be distracting, and sometimes you
   want to record yourself _with_ a metronome).

2. Create an `exercise library` of proficiency-tests/drills/exercises (or simply
   use the one provided here). Each drill in the library should
   include complete documentation on how to perform the exercise, proficiency
   criteria, examples, etc. More on this below.

3. Create a
   [Zettelkasten](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1)
   of index cards to track your `excercise-sessions` (at least one card per
   exercise). We are using a modified version of the general
   Zettelkasten note-taking system. 
   
   I _think_ I prefer binder-rings to a box of cards, but I might change my mind
   down the road. See below for details.
   
   You'll need a few inexpensive office supplies:

   * [Blank 3x5 index cards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X5CSNVH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
   * [Colored 3x5 index
     cards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XSXXKFZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
     to use as separators. You may want to use [plastic
     separators](https://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Index-Inches-Assorted-Colors/dp/B0000AQOET/ref=sr_1_1)
     instead.
   * [A set of binder
     rings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081YXSV89/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
     to hold your cards.
   * [A single hole
     punch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XP9CPWQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
   * [A multi-colored
     pen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ODR688E/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s001)
   
   &nbsp;

4. Write down a list of one to five things that you want to practice for the
   next several days, weeks or months onto a colored index card. This is your `focus list`.

   Place your `focus list` at the very front of your _Zettelkasten_. Place a
   different colored separator card behind your focus list, and 20-50 blank cards behind
   that separator. Later, your sorted cards will go between the `focus list` and
   separator card. Unsorted cards will go after the separator. Lastly, try to
   keep at least 20 or so blank cards after your unsorted cards.

   You may replace any item on your `focus list` whenever you want, but never
   allow yourself more than 5 things on the list (fewer is even better).
   
   The `focus list` accomplishes three things:
   
   * You'll never stop practicing something without a _conscious_ decision
     (as opposed to forgetting about it because you were distracted by something
     else).
   * You'll never be at a loss for _what_ to practice.
   * You'll never feel overwhelmed because you're studying too many things at
     once. If you're working with a teacher, don't be afraid to tell him or her
     that you _don't_ want to work on something new because your focus
     list is full!

## Defining terms

Your `focus list` contains up to five drills from your `exercise library`. Your
`exercise library` is a master list of exercises: everything you might ever want
to practice. Think of it like checking out items from a real-world library:
you're only allowed to check out up to five items at a time onto your `focus
list`. Each drill in your library has an ID (sort of like an ISBN number).

An `exercise-session` is one attempt with any drill.

Your _Zettels_ (cards) track each time you practice an individual drill, and
allow you to keep notes from that session.

Since over time you'll continuously add exercises to your library, and items
will also come and go on your `focus list`, considerable time may elapse between
`exercise sessions` for the same drill.

The purpose of the _Zettelkasten_ is to keep
your notes as organized as possible (and close together) no matter how long you
go between sessions.

## The process 

1. Select an item from your `focus list` to practice.

2. If you've never practiced the exercise before, create a new card for the
   item, otherwise find the card for the most recent session and review your notes.
   Most days you'll only work on one to three exercises.

3. Practice the exercise.

4. When you finish, annotate the appropriate card with the date, the amount of
   time you spent practicing, and any other notes you think might be worthwhile.
   You may want to track cumulative minutes in addition to the time on this
   individual `exercise-session`.
   
   Write down any thoughts you have about the exercise. Think of things you
   might want to review next time: 
   
   * Do you feel you're improving? Struggling?
   * Anything to focus on particularly? Was there any movement/section/fingering that was
     particularly difficult? Did you forget something in the middle?
   * What metronome settings did you use? 
   * Which chords/keys/sections/etc. did you practice? 
   * If you didn't complete the exercise, is there someplace you want to pick up next time?
   
6. Repeat with the next exercise you want to practice, or quit for the day if
   you're energy is running low.

## The exercise library

The `exercise library` contains _everything_ you might ever want to practice.
You should try to create new exercises whenever you stumble across something
interesting in a book, magazine, online course, video, or even a conversation
with a band-mate.

The library will grow without bound, so it must be easy to add (and
_insert_) exercises to the library whenever we want.

Every exercise/drill/proficiency-test must have a **short** ID you can use to
reference it from your Zettelkasten cards. Writing out long titles gets old in
a hurry.

Exercises are often _hierarchical_. It's common, for example, to have a master
proficiency test (like "demonstrate fretboard note-location proficiency") with
several sub-drills or sub-sub drills (like "find natural notes on the E string"
or "practice finding notes with octave shapes").

I recommend a `Zettelkasten` naming style for IDs, e.g.: ..., RT9, RT9a, RT9b,
RT9C, RT9C1, RT9C1a, RT9C1b, RT9C2, RT9D, RT10, etc. This allows easy insertion
of new drills into an existing hierarchy while still keeping similar drills
close together.

This site contains **my** master list of drills, and you're welcome to use it,
but you should also maintain _your own_ library of exercises as well. All of my
exercise IDs are prefixed "RT". The exercises in your library (or anyone else's
that you chose to use) should be prefixed with one or two different letters.

A simple bound notebook with a new page for each exercise suffices for your own
library, but if you're at all technically inclined, I **highly** recommend an
electronic library, since you'll almost certainly want to link to
videos, images, tabs/sheet-music, and other media.

A folder of Microsoft Word or Google Docs documents will work.

My strong recommendation is to use
[markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)
files on [ github ](https://github.com) with 
[github-pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

[Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)
allows you to easily link to videos, diagrams, tabs, etc. as required without
losing focus on the content you're creating.
[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) and [github](https://github.com) make version
control and backup simple and automatic.
[Github-pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
makes it trivial to publish your library on the internet if you so desire.

One note about IDs: don't worry too much about getting them right, and avoid the
temptation to change any existing exercise's ID. It's just a label in the end,
and it doesn't matter that much if things aren't perfectly ordered. 

Note that you can always reference (link to) one exercise from any other, as
well as from any _Zettel_.

## Zettels and the Zettelkasten

I don't want to be _too_ prescriptive since I'm figuring this out for myself as
well, but I don't want to leave everything open ended. Here are my thoughts on
the layout of each individual _Zettel_ (note card):

1. Use "portrait" orientation. This will force you to write smaller and avoid
   being too verbose. Remember that you can _always_ continue onto another card,
   however! Only write on one side of the cards.

2. Decide ahead of time how you will use color. I've decided on the following:

   * BLACK: most content
   * Green: IDs and links to things not on the card
   * Blue: metadata or secondary information
   * RED: errors, warnings, and corrections

3. Every card gets a unique id (e.g. 2b, 3c1, or 4h19b3 for a particularly deep
   and wide hierarchy). 
   
   * Write each card's own ID in the upper right-hand corner (in green).

   * Create new cards (with new IDs) whenever you practice a new exercise (or
     want to take a note on something unrelated to any particular exercise).

   * Be sure to write at least the ID of the exercise you're practicing
     somewhere on the card (in green). You may want to include a few words from
     the title or description as well.

   * To add cards to an existing topic, create a new card with an ID one level
     lower. For example, if I'd previously created a card with ID "19" to
     practice exercise "RT4b3", but ran out of room while writing notes, I'd
     continue my thoughts onto a new blank card, and label it "RT4b3a".

   * Link to other cards whenever you want by writing the ID for that card in
     green.

   * If you continue a thought or make a connection onto another card, 
     link the cards bi-directionally: At the very bottom of the first card, write
     "cont." (or an arrow) followed by the ID of the new card. On the new card,
     write the prior card's id in the upper _left_ corner: (e.g. "see RT4b3").
     Again, links and IDs should be in green.

The _Zettelkasten_ itself has four sections. In order: `focus list`, sorted
cards, unsorted cards, and finally blank cards.

Always take notes on
## The rules in detail

### 1. Practice what you want

At the risk of stating the obvious: if you hate to practice, then eventually you
_won't_ practice. Full stop.

Ideally, practice should be at least somewhat enjoyable, but keep the following in mind:

- There is no point in practicing what you've already mastered. Warm-up drills
  and some technique exercises are an exception.

- If what you're practicing is too hard, you'll hate practicing. If something is
  too difficult, break it into smaller chunks and practice those in turn,
  building up to the full exercise. It's best to take baby steps.

- Try to balance the six T's: training (general/mixed topics), theory,
  technique, tones (ear training), tunes, and timing. This isn't necessary every
  session, but strive for balance over the long haul.

- Remember that _you play what you practice._ The way you practice scales,
  triads, etc. will show up in your playing eventually. If you only practice
  scales by mechanically going up and down the scale linearly with a monotonous
  rhythm, guess how your solos will sound? Try to be musical with
  your practice. (This is why almost all my exercises proceed in
  fourths, by the way.)

### 2. Track what you practice

The simple act of writing down what you're working on helps you focus.

It's motivational to track how much _time_ you spend practicing. A kitchen timer
will keep you honest.

**Use a metronome**. A metronome helps not only to build speed, but also to
measure progress. Remember that you can use whole notes, half notes, quarter
notes, triplets, and sixteenth notes in addition to adjusting the BPM!

**Record yourself**. Objectively listening to yourself is a million times easier
if you _aren't currently focused on playing_. Get in the habit of recording
yourself often. Go back and listen to old recordings periodically, too.

### 3. Never work on more than five things at a time

Three things at a time is even better (but hard to stick to).

Your `focus list` should change slowly, certainly no more than every several
days. If you're tired of working on something, feel free to swap it out for
anything else that interests you, but **nothing feels better than taking
something off the list because you've already mastered it**. Persistence is a virtue.
