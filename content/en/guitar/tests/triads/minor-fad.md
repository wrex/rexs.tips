## Procedure

This is the minor version of the major FAD I-IV-V exercise

This test is to play i-iv-i-v-i chord progressions on the top four strings in
every key, while moving your hand as little as possible.

We will be playing minor triads on the top *four* strings. You can view this as
"merged" forms of the DGB and GBE triads, or simply recognize that the same note
is doubled on the highest and lowest notes. Unlike the major triad shapes, there
is really only one way to finger the minor triads on the top four strings.

The test is performed with quarter notes at 110 BPM. Play bars of four beats,
with one chord per bar.

As always, we will progress through the cycle of fourths (which hopefully you've
memorized by now!).

1. Find the lowest four string triad shape on the neck for the current note.
   That is your i chord. Visualize where the root is in that shape, then
   visualize where the 4th and 5th scale degrees lie on adjacent strings.

2. Play each chord in the progression at that position. Strum the i chord four
   times (one per click) then four beats of the iv, etc. Complete the i-iv-i-v-i
   progression at that position. Avoid moving your hand any more than necessary
   (use the root notes you identified in step 1).

3. Move up the neck to the next triad shape for the I chord and repeat the
   i-iv-i-v-i progression.

4. Move up the neck again and to the final triad shape for the i chord and
   repeat the progression again.

Complete steps 1-4 for every natural note key (progressing in fourths).


## Pass criteria

Complete the exercise with quarter notes at 110BPM and four beats per chord
without any mistakes.
