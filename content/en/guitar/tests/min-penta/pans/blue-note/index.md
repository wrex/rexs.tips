## Demonstration

TODO

## Procedure

Repeat {{< tdgref "min-penta/pans/min-blues" >}} but this time use the entire
six note blues scale, including the &flat;5 blue note (the middle of the
"handle").

Explore the sound of the blue note, and try different techniques to resolve the
dissonance (bending or sliding up or down a half step, as well as resolving to
other notes).

If you create a phrase that you particularly like, repeat it. Write it down.
Record yourself. Start building a vocabulary of your own licks.
