Next up, let's look at box 2 of the minor pentatonic scale:

{{< figproc "second" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

Practice this new shape until you've got it under your fingers. Pay particular
attention to how this next minor triad shape on the top four strings lies within
the box.

Proficiency test for box 2 in isolation. Don't proceed any further until you
have both the box 1 and box 2 shapes mastered.
{{< /tdgalert >}}

You **don't** need to memorize the names of the box shapes, only how to play
them and how to connect them to one another. We have to call them something in
these pages, though, so boxes 1-5 it is.

It should be obvious that box 2 connects to box 1. It's just starts three frets
higher.

Rather than continuing to box 3, however, let's look at the other shape
that connects to box 1:

{{< figproc "fifth" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

{{< tdgalert "min-penta/boxes/box5" >}}
Proficiency test for box 5 in isolation. Note how this shape sits below the box 1 shape.
{{< /tdgalert >}}

In order to gain proficiency on the neck, it's important to program your fingers
to connect the shapes together. In addition to learning each box in isolation,
it's important to practice them in "chunks" of connected groups. The first of
these is boxes 5, 1, and 2:

{{< tdgalert "min-penta/boxes/boxes512" >}}
Program your fingers to play the first three boxes as one "chunk".
