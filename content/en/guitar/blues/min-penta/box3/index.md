We've covered three of the five pentatonic shapes. Let's add one more:

{{< figproc "third" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

Notice that, like box 5, box 3 also sits _between_ two triad shapes. Neither
triad on the top three strings is completely contained within box 3.

As always, we'll first practice the single shape by itself.

{{< tdgalert "min-penta/boxes/box3" >}}
Practice box 3 thoroughly before continuing.
{{< /tdgalert >}}

Now let's practice connecting shapes 1, 2, and 3:

{{< tdgalert "min-penta/boxes/boxes123" >}}
When ready, practice the next "chunk" of three boxes together.
{{< /tdgalert >}}

We've now covered quite a bit of the fretboard. To really hammer it home, let's
connect a chunk of **four** boxes:

{{< tdgalert "min-penta/boxes/boxes5123" >}}
Connecting four of the five pentatonic boxes together.
