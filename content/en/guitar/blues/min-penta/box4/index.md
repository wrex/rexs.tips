Just one more box shape to go!

{{< figproc "fourth" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

In the key of Am, this shape can either be played in open position or at the
12th fret (as shown). While the fingering is very different, and you should
definitely practice playing it in both locations, the shape is the same.

Practice box4 in isolation before continuing.

Take your time with these. Each box you add to your repertoire increases the
complexity exponentially. It takes weeks at a minumum (more likely, months) to truly master these exercises.

Since this is the last box shape, it connects back to the box 5 shape we've
already learned. That means there are _two_ serpentine drills to practice:

## Congratulations!

If you've made it to this point, you're now well on your way to mastering the
fretboard. 

Take a gander [that intimidating diagram from the beginning of this chapter]({{<
ref "guitar/blues/min-penta#Am-wholeneck.md" >}}). It's quite an accomplishment
to have all of that memorized!

You should be comfortable finding notes to solo with all over the neck with this
newfound knowledge. Put on a minor blues backing track and explore every
different slur and articulation you can think of. Make up your own licks. Have
fun, you've earned it!

You should also find it **much** easier to pick out licks from some of
your favorite songs now. Pentatonic licks are _everywhere_.

You're now ready to attempt the master proficiency test for all the minor pentatonic
scale: {{< tdgref "min-penta/boxes" >}}.
