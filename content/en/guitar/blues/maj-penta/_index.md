We've spent a tremendous amount of effort covering the _minor_ pentatonic scale
because it's the simplest and most generally useful scale for soloing. Again,
the minor pentatonic scale works even over _major_ chord progressions (with
care) but the opposite is definitely **not** true. Major scales generally sound
terrible over minor chords.

The huge majority of songs are written in _major_ keys, however, so it's
time we learned how to play major pentatonic scales.

The good news is the box shapes are actually identical (just shifted down three
frets)!

The bad news is that **you must think about the notes within the shapes
completely differently** to use them effectively.

## Background

As covered previously, The minor pentatonic scale comprises the root, &flat;3,
P4, P5, and &flat;7 scale degrees. In the key of Am, that's the notes A, C, D, E, and G.

[Diatonic theory]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/notes/just-12-notes" >}}) taught
us that every major scale ("Ionian mode") has a relative minor (Aeolian mode)
and vice versa.

In other words, the white keys on a piano can either be thought of as the C
Major scale, or the A minor scale.

In the same way, the notes from the Am pentatonic scale are the same as the C
_Major_ pentatonic scale. The five notes C, D, E, G, and A now become the root,
M2, M3, P5, and M6 of the **Major** pentatonic scale.

The same single octave "frying pan" we looked at earlier can be minor or major,
depending on context:

{{< figproc "Am-frying-pan" "Fit" "800x200" >}}{{< /figproc >}}
{{< figproc "major-frying-pan" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

Note that the root is now located at the "toe" of the pan rather than the heel!

The same thing happens with multi-octave patters. Here's "box 1" shown first as Am pentatonic, then as C _Major_
pentatonic:

{{< figproc "Am-pentatonic-box1" "Fit" "800x280" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

{{< figproc "C-pentatonic-box1" "Fit" "800x280" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

It's the same notes!

The shapes are identical, but the _function_ of the notes changes.

Even the blue note is still the blue note. It now functions as a &flat;3 instead
of a &flat;5!

{{< alert title="Caution!" color="warning" >}}
Many books will tell you that you can form a major pentatonic "scale" (really a
box-shaped fragment) by moving a minor pentatonic "box" three frets lower.

In other words, to play A _major_ pentatonic, we could take the box 1 shape from
figure 1 and move it down three frets. Alternately, to play C _minor_
pentatonic, we could move it _up_ three frets.

It's not that simple, though, because you can't just take the same
minor licks and phrases you've been using for minor chords and use them in a
major context. It's vitally important to emphasize _chord tones_ in your solo, the
root in particular.

If you move box 1 down three frets and play the same licks, you're going to
emphasize F&sharp; and it's going to sound like F&sharp; minor, not A major!

In particular, if you're playing over a major chord, the M3 note will sound
consonant, and the m3 will be dissonant. Playing the M3 over a minor chord is
even worse!

That's why I strongly recommend thinking of the major pentatonic scale as
completely different from the minor pentatonic. That they happen to have
the same box shapes is just an artifact of modal theory. You _use_ them in
utterly different ways.

While our fingers are already familiar with the box shapes, we
still need to program our ears and brain to start "seeing" them
in a major context rather than minor.

Use this exercise to "see" and hear the _major_ sounds hidden in the same shapes
we've been playing.
