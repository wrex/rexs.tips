You've already learned all five boxes in a minor context. It's now time to learn
how to use them in a major context.

{{< alert title="Printable reference" color="info" >}} 
I've created a [printable reference pdf]({{< resourceref "all-boxes.pdf" >}}) for
all five shapes in both major and minor
contexts. More than anything else, these shapes and ideas helped me learn how
to solo freely over most rock, blues, country, and folk songs. Don't
underestimate the power of these diagrams! 
{{< /alert >}}

Here are the five pentatonic boxes shown in both major and minor contexts. Note
that I've only annotated the root notes and chord tones. You should be able to
work out the remaining notes (M2, P4, M6, or &flat;7) on your own.

{{< figproc "box1" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}
{{< figproc "box2" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}
{{< figproc "box3" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}
{{< figproc "box4" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}
{{< figproc "box5" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

The exercises should go faster since your fingers already know the shapes. Only
the context has changed. You may want to go back and repeat some of the minor
exercises to get used to switching back and forth.

Take your time working through all of these exercises. Just be methodical and
track your progress. Trust the process and don't worry if it takes you several
weeks or months to master everything. 

These are just a repeat of the process we used with minor pentatonic boxes:
