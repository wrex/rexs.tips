This is a static website created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using the
[Docsy](https://docsy.dev) theme. All of the content is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org).

You may want to subscribe to the RSS feed for the [guitar section of my
blog]({{< ref "/blog/guitar" >}}) if you want to know when I've made major
changes or additions to the guitar book. I intend to publish a blog entry
whenever I make significant changes to this book.

If your screen is wide enough (on a desktop browser) you should see links on the
right side to edit the current page or to create a documentation issue on
Github. You'll need an account on [Github](https://github.com) to do either.

The left side navigation is for the entire book. On longer pages, you'll see
navigation for section headers *within* the page on the right (with a wide
enough screen).

Please log [a documentation
issue](https://github.com/wrex/rexs.tips/issues/new?title=General%20query) if
you have any questions or concerns.
