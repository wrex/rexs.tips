## Content types

There are two different types of content in this course:

* *Documentation pages* explain theory and practical lessons/tutorials to assist
  in learning.

* Drills and *Proficiency tests* are practical *exercises*, usually with
  objective criteria to let you know when you've mastered the exercise.

Basically, read most of these pages like a book, but when you're ready to start
practicing, head over to [tests]({{< ref "/guitar/rexercises" >}}) and
follow the instructions.

Proficiency tests are the result of what I'm calling [Test Driven Guitar]({{<
ref "/guitar/rexercises/test-driven-guitar" >}}). Feel free to skip that
chapter if you just want to get on with learning the instrument.

## Notation

As much as possible I will try to be consistent with the following conventions.

Sadly, much of this content was already written before I documented the
notation, so there are likely quite a few pages that still need updating!

### Notes

The seven natural notes will always be written in the default font with an
uppercase letter. The five remaining notes will be notated with a sharp or flat
symbol as appropriate.

The twelve possible notes will always be written as follows:

* A
* A&sharp; or B&flat;
* B
* C
* C&sharp; or D&flat;
* D
* D&sharp; or E&flat;
* E
* F
* F&sharp; or G&flat;
* G
* G&sharp; or A&flat;

### Intervals

This course refers to intervals as ascending some number of intervals from the
reference note (usually the scale key or the root note of a chord).

The course will usually use this notation for intervals.

| semitones | notation
| ---                 | ---
| 0                   | P1 or unison
| 1                   | m2, A1
| 2                   | M2 or d3
| 3                   | m3, &flat;3 or A2
| 4                   | M3 or d4
| 5                   | P4 or A3
| 6                   | d5, &flat;5, tritone or "blue note"
| 7                   | P5 or d6
| 8                   | m6 or A5
| 9                   | M6 or d7
| 10                  | m7, &flat;7 or A6
| 11                  | M7 or d8
| 12                  | P8, octave, or A7

Where "P" is for "perfect" intervals, "m" for minor intervals, M for major, "d"
for diminished, and "A" for augmented. Refer to the
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)) for further details
(lots and lots of details).

The first notation listed is almost always preferred.

### Chords

This course attempts to be consistent with chord naming, but it can be difficult.

Any chord symbol **always** starts with an uppercase letter for the root of the
chord.

Whenever possible, the quality of the chord is included and abbreviated: "Maj",
"m", "dim", or "aug" rather than using symbols or single letters. The "M" in
Major is capitalized.

Thus, "CMaj" rather than "C&bigtriangleup;" or just the plain letter "C" (to
avoid confusion with notes or keys).

Common seventh chords are written like C7, CMaj7, Cm7.

Diminished chords are written like "Cdim" rather than "C&ordm;".

Half diminished chords are always written like "Cm7&flat;5" rather than "C&oslash;".

Suspended chords are written Csus2 or Csus4 (and the 2 or 4 will always be
included).

If the m7 is present in the chord, extended chords will be written C9 or C13. If
the m7 is *not* present they become Cadd2 or Cadd6.

Slash chords indicate either a specific inversion where necessary, or an *added*
bass note not normally in the chord. For brevity, the three letter abbreviation
is *not* used for chord quality in slash chords. C/E is the first inversion of
CMaj., Cm/G is the second inversion of Cm, and CMaj7/F is CMaj with an
additional F played in the bass.

Please refer to the [wikipedia page on
chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)) if any other notation is
confusing.

### Chord progressions: Roman numerals

The triads formed from a diatonic scale are written in Roman numerals. Uppercase
refers to Major chords, lowercase to minor.

The diatonic chords are thus written as follows: I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi,
vii&ordm; (note that the symbol **is** used for diminished triads with Roman
notation). In the key of C, these would be the chords CMaj, Dm, Em, FMaj, GMaj,
Am, and Bdim.

### Keys

To prevent confusion with chords or notes, keys will usually be written in
angled quotes:

> The key of &laquo;C&raquo; is also called "C Major" but is different than the
> chord CMaj or the note C.

### Scale degrees

Whenever it's necessary to refer to scale degrees I will prefix with a small
circumflex preceding the number: &circ;5 is the fifth scale degree.

(Scale degrees are traditionally written with a caret or hat on top of the
number, but adding those glyphs to this site is more of a hassle than I'm
willing to undertake.)
