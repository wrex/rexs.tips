The system comprises:

1. A [practice area](#practice-area)

2. An [exercise library](#exercise-library)

3. A ring or box of note cards, your [_Zettelkasten_](#zettelkasten) with one or
   more notes for each "exercise-session"

4. One special Zettel, your [focus list](#focus-list)

#### Practice area

You'll need a dedicated `practice area.` Make it as distraction-free as possible. The
corner of a room suffices, but everything you need should always be out and
ready to go. Make it as comfortable as possible, so that it's _someplace you
want to be_.
  
Phone apps work for the timer and metronome, but dedicated hardware is better
(switching between apps on your phone can be distracting, and sometimes you
want to record yourself _with_ a metronome).

I like to have both a wall calendar and a clock visible at a glance (though again, your phone
suffices).

#### Exercise library

The `exercise library` contains a list proficiency-tests/drills/exercises. You
can create your own or simply use [the ones provided here]({{< ref
"guitar/rexs-system/compact-test-listing" >}}). Each drill in the library should
include complete documentation on how to perform the exercise, proficiency
criteria, examples, etc.

The `exercise library` contains _everything_ you might ever want to practice
more than once. You should create new exercises whenever you stumble across something
interesting in a book, magazine, online course, video, or even a conversation
with a band-mate.

The library will grow without bound, so make it easy to add (and
_insert_) new exercises.

Every exercise/drill/proficiency-test must have a **short** ID. You'll reference
the IDs from your Zettelkasten cards, so we use short IDs rather than titles.
Writing out long titles gets old in a hurry.

Exercises are often _hierarchical_. It's common, for example, to have a master
proficiency test (like "demonstrate proficiency locating notes on the fretboard") with
several sub-drills or sub-sub drills (like "find natural notes on the E string"
or "practice finding notes with octave shapes").

I recommend a `Zettelkasten` naming style for IDs, e.g.: ..., RT9, RT9a, RT9b,
RT9C, RT9C1, RT9C1a, RT9C1b, RT9C2, RT9D, RT10, etc. This allows easy insertion
of new drills into an existing hierarchy while still keeping related drills
close together (you can go wide or go deep as required).

This site contains **my** master list of drills, and you're welcome to use it,
but you should also maintain _your own_ library of exercises as well. All of my
exercise IDs are prefixed "RT". Use a different prefix for the exercises in your library.

A simple three-ring notebook with a new page for each exercise suffices for your
own library, but if you're at all technically inclined, I **highly** recommend
an electronic library, since you'll almost certainly want to link to videos,
images, tabs/sheet-music, and other media.

A folder of Microsoft Word or Google Docs documents should work.

My suggestion is to use
[markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)
files on [ github ](https://github.com) with 
[github-pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

[Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)
allows you to easily link to videos, diagrams, tabs, etc. as required without
losing focus on the content you're creating.
[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) and [github](https://github.com) make version
control and backup simple and automatic.
[Github-pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
makes it trivial to publish your library on the internet if you so desire.

One note about IDs: don't worry too much about getting them right, and avoid the
temptation to change any existing exercise's ID. It's just a label in the end,
and it doesn't matter that much if things aren't perfectly ordered.

#### Zettelkasten

##### Background

The [history of Zettelkasten](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542866502/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_dcHWEbCA4024P)
is fascinating. A _ridiculously_ prolific sociologist (58 books and hundreds of
articles, many classics in their field) named Niklas Luhman developed the system.

Luhman created a lifelong note-taking system for academics. _Zettel_ apparently
means "note" in German, and _Kasten_ means "box". _Zettelkasten_ is just a
teutonically prescriptive way to take notes. It allows you to keep related notes
close together and organized in hierarchies. I found this [summary of how to use
Zettelkasten](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1)
quite helpful.

I just want to make my guitar practice as efficient as possible, but many of
Luhman's ideas seem directly applicable.

Luhman's system appeals to me expressly _because_ it only uses handwritten notes
on simple index cards. I also like the smaller form factor of cards-on-a-ring over a
notebook (it's easier to throw in a gig bag!).

{{% alert color="info" %}}
I prefer a ring to a box, but either should work. The important thing is that you
are able to easily re-order cards within your Zettelkasten.

One nice thing about cards on a ring is that I can hold it in my left hand like
a stenographer's pad even with a guitar on my lap. The remaining cards provide a
nice stiff backing pad to write on (much easier than writing on a single flimsy
card held in the air).
{{% /alert %}}

As I mentioned above, I'm leery of touching the computer during practice: I
_know_ that once I put down my guitar and start typing on a computer or phone,
I'm doomed. It could be minutes, hours, or literally days until I get back to
the guitar.

Luhman's _short_ but arbitrarily expandable ID scheme makes it easy to
"hyperlink" between cards using just a short ID for each card.

##### Applying the idea

My Zettelkasten is organized into four major sections, separated by colored
cards. I also put plastic cards at each end (to protect the cards and so that I
can find the start!).

1. A single colored card at the very front contains my `focus list`. I scratch
   out and replace items on this card whenever I want. Whenever it becomes too cluttered to
   read, I replace it with a new one.

2. Next is a section with all my "general" notes I might create during a
   practice session that aren't tied to a particular exercise. These might be
   thoughts for a blog article, song ideas, whatever. They get normal
   Zettelkasten IDs (e.g. 1, 1a, 1a1, 1b, 2, ...) that can go arbitrarily deep
   or wide.

3. This is followed by a section with my notes on individual exercises. I have
   one card for each exercise in my library that I've actually practiced. The
   first card I create for an exercise has the same ID as the exercise itself
   ("RTxxxx").
   
   I add notes to the appropriate card every time I practice the exercise. If I
   run out of room, I continue onto a new card. The ID for added cards is: 
   exercise ID "/" additional hierarchy.

   For example, I have exercises {{< tdgref "triads/major-arpeggios" >}} and {{<
   tdgref "triads/maj-gbe" >}} in my library. If I'd practiced both at least
   once, I'd have at least one card for each in my Zettelkasten: one with ID
   `RT4a` and one with ID `RT4a1`.

   If I ran out of room or wanted to add related ideas to card `RT4a,` I'd
   create a new card with ID `RT4a/1` (note that this is a different ID than
   `RT4a1`). I'd then continue onto `RT4a/2`, etc. I could also branch downward
   if it made sense (say `RT4a/2a`).

4. Last up is a section of unsorted and blank cards. I always try to keep at
   least twenty or so blank cards available.

As suggested by [abramdemski](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/abramdemski), I use
the section of unsorted cards as a sort of recency buffer.

I always write new notes on the first blank card. New notes stay in that last
section for a while until I choose to sort them into place, so recent notes tend
to stay together.

##### Card layout

I don't want to be _too_ prescriptive since I'm still figuring this out for
myself as well, but neither do I want to leave everything open ended, so here
are my thoughts on the layout of each individual _Zettel_ (note card):

1. Use "portrait" orientation and only write on one face of the cards. This will
   force you to write smaller and avoid being too verbose. Remember that you can
   _always_ continue onto another card. I sought out blank index cards before
   realizing the "backs" of ruled index cards are usually blank!

2. Decide if you want to use color. Personally, I've decided against it. My eyes
   are bad, and I lose pens constantly. I want to use whatever writing implement
   I find first rather than depending on a multi-colored pen. 
   
   If you do use color, I suspect it pays to be consistent. Maybe:

   * BLACK: most content
   * Green: IDs and links to things not on the card
   * Blue: metadata or secondary information
   * RED: errors, warnings, and corrections

3. Decide on the layout and "typography" for your cards:

   I always put each card's ID in the upper right hand corner. 
   
   I leave room on the upper left for "see also" links: other cards that link to
   this one. It's often useful to provide bi-directional listings between two
   cards.
   
   If I run out of room on a card, I write a downward arrow (shorthand for
   "continued") then the ID of the card I continue onto.

   I put a box around "hyperlinks" in any note text that refer to the IDs of other cards or
   exercises. I don't put boxes around IDs in the upper corners or the bottom of the card.

4. Every card gets a unique id (e.g. `2b, 3c1,` or `4h19b3` for a particularly deep
   and wide hierarchy). 
   
   * Create new cards (with new IDs) whenever you practice a new exercise (or
     want to take a note on something unrelated to any particular exercise).

   * To continue thoughts that overflow an existing card, simply create a new
     one. For example, if I'd previously created a card with ID `RT4b3/19` for
     practice exercise `RT4b3`, but ran out of room while writing notes, I'd
     continue my thoughts onto a new blank card, and label it `RT4b3/20`.

   * If you have a new but related thought thought you can add another level of
     depth in the hierarchy. Maybe `RT4b3/19a.`

#### Focus list

The `focus list` contains a list of one to five exercises that I want to practice for the next
several days, weeks or months.

**You may replace any item on your focus list whenever you want,** but never
allow yourself more than five things on the list (fewer is even better).

The five items on your `focus list` should be _exercises_ that you can complete
(but not necessarily master) within a single practice session. That doesn't mean
you can't have higher level goals on your focus list! 

I use longer-term goals as headings/categories on my `focus list` with
individual exercises below each heading that I swap out frequently. 

For example: I currently want to focus on _timing_ (rhythm) and _tunes_
(repertoire) over the next month or two, so I've currently got two items under
the "timing" header, and one under "tunes".

The `focus list` accomplishes three things:

* You'll never stop practicing something without a _conscious_ decision
  (as opposed to forgetting about it because you were distracted by something
  else).
* You'll never be at a loss for _what_ to practice.
* You'll never feel overwhelmed because you're studying too many things at
  once. If you're working with a teacher, don't be afraid to tell him or her
  that you _don't_ want to work on something new because your focus
  list is full!
