1. Select an item from your `focus list` to practice.

2. If you've never practiced the exercise before, create a new card for the
   item, otherwise find the card for the most recent session and review your notes.
   Most days you'll only work on one to three exercises.

3. Practice the exercise.

4. When you finish, annotate the appropriate card with the date, the amount of
   time you spent practicing, and any other notes you think might be worthwhile.
   You may want to track cumulative minutes in addition to the time on this
   individual `exercise-session`.
   
   Write down any thoughts you have about the exercise. Think of things you
   might want to review next time: 
   
   * Do you feel you're improving? Struggling?
   * Anything to focus on particularly? Was there any movement/section/fingering that was
     particularly difficult? Did you forget something in the middle?
   * What metronome settings did you use? 
   * Which chords/keys/sections/etc. did you practice? 
   * If you didn't complete the exercise, is there someplace you want to pick up next time?
   
6. Repeat with the next exercise you want to practice, or quit for the day if
   you're energy is running low.
