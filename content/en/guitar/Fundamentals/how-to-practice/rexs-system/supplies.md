You've probably got most of what you need already on hand, but here's the
complete list of things you'll need to implement this system. The items I've
linked to are just examples, not recommendations.

#### Office supplies

* [Blank 3x5 index cards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X5CSNVH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
* [Colored 3x5 index
  cards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XSXXKFZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
  to use as separators.
* [A set of binder
  rings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081YXSV89/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
  to hold your cards.
* [A single hole
  punch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XP9CPWQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)
* (optional) [A multi-colored
  pen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ODR688E/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s001)
  
#### Electronics

* A [kitchen timer](https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Timer-Digital-Countdown-Stopwatch/dp/B07D3BFY6R/ref=sr_1_5)
* A [metronome](https://www.amazon.com/SEIKO-SQ50V-SQ50-V-Quartz-Metronome/dp/B000LFCXL8/ref=sr_1_5)
* A [tuner](https://www.amazon.com/Snark-SN5X-Guitar-Violin-Current/dp/B01H74YV56/ref=sr_1_5)
* Some way to _easily_ record yourself. A smartphone is fine. Audio only recordings suffice, but
  videos are even better. You'll need:
* (optional but recommended) a decent mic and a way to connect it and your guitar to your
  computer/tablet/phone (usually via a USB-audio interface like the
  [Scarlett
  2i2](https://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools/dp/B01E6T56EA))
* (optional but recommended) A [looper
  pedal](https://www.amazon.com/Rowin-Unlimited-Overdubs-Minutes-Looping/dp/B073VJK551/ref=sr_1_1_sspa)
  of some sort

#### Software 

* (strongly recommended) [iRealPRO](https://irealpro.com) (To create simple backing
  tracks for practice)
* (optional but recommended) A DAW of some sort ([garage band](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) or the like).
* (optional) A habit tracking app like
  [strides](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strides-goals-habits-tracker/id672401817)
  on iOS or
  [loop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_US)
  on Android.

#### Miscellaneous

* A [guitar
  stand](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Folding-Acoustic-Electric-Guitars/dp/B018FCZKR2/ref=sr_1_3)
  so your guitar is always out of it's case and ready to go.
* A
  [tripod](https://www.amazon.com/UBeesize-Phone-Tripod-Wireless-Compatible/dp/B07837W5NX/ref=sxin_9_ac_d_pm)
  and
  [holder](https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Adapter-Adjustable-Compatible-Camcorder/dp/B07SQ8TQT9/ref=sr_1_4)
  for your phone or camera
* A wall calendar and clock
