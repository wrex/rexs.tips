Fair warning: the system described here is still quite new. It's still in flux and
somewhat aspirational (as of May, 2020). I've **not** yet used it long enough to
create real-world examples, and some rough edges are bound to remain. Your
mileage may vary.

After countless failed attempts at following other's practice systems, my own
practice system has evolved into what's described in this section.

Don't let the length fool you. The system isn't _at all_ complicated. I've
learned the hard way that I'll give up on any system that isn't dirt simple.

At its heart, it's just three things:

1. An [exercise library]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice/rexs-system/system-components#exercise-library" >}})
2. Handwritten notes on index cards (my [Zettelkasten]({{< ref
   "guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice/rexs-system/system-components#zettelkasten">}}))
3. One note in particular contains my current [focus list]({{< ref
   "guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice/rexs-system/system-components#focus-list" >}}) (the five or fewer
   exercises I'm currently focused on)

Every time I stumble across something new and interesting online or wherever, I
add one or more items to my [exercise library]({{< ref
"guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice/rexs-system/system-components#exercise-library"
>}}).

If it's particularly interesting, I'll replace one of the items on my [focus
list]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice/rexs-system/system-components#focus-list" >}}).

To keep myself _focused_, I force myself to keep five or fewer items on my
[focus list]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice/rexs-system/system-components#focus-list" >}}). Any
more than that and I have a hard time deciding what to practice on any given day.

{{< figproc "focus-list.jpg" "Resize" "400x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

I still let myself watch whatever videos and read whatever content I want. If
something seems worthwhile, I'll add a link to it from my library. 

But before I take up any valuable practice time with the latest cool video or
whatever, I first look at my [focus list]({{< ref
"guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice/rexs-system/system-components#focus-list"
>}}) and ask myself if the new thing seems more important or valuable than
everything already there.

Sometimes I realize I've already mastered something on the list,
so I feel no guilt about replacing it with the new thing. Other times, an item on
the list no longer "sparks joy" as Marie Kondo would say, so I drop it and put
the new thing in its place.

Usually, though, I realize I've already got plenty to work on, so I just
add the link to my library and relax knowing I won't forget about it and will
get to it eventually.

Neither my focus list nor my exercise library are in **any** sort of priority
order &mdash; I work on what I want when I want.

[Josh](mailto:josh@fretboardanatomy.com) over at [Fretboard
Anatomy](https://fretboardanatomy.com) gave me most of the ideas that led to
this system. In particular, many of the exercises documented here are slightly
modified versions of drills that he taught me. He also turned me on to the
[Zettelkasten](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1)
system of note-taking.

## Pen vs. computer

I've tried various phone and computer apps to manage my practice, but I've found
I **strongly** prefer a pen and paper to take notes during practice. 

For some reason, scribbling something with a pen seems far less intrusive and
distracting than typing on my phone or on a computer. A pen requires far less of
a [context switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

I want to avoid a computer keyboard if at all possible _while practicing_, but
my exercise _documentation_ must link to videos, audio files, neck diagrams,
tablature/notation, _etc._

My solution is to maintain an exercise library on my computer, but use hand-written notes
on index cards while practicing. The notes refer back to exercises in the
library.

I rarely need to refer to the online documentation for a particular exercise
after practicing it the first time.


## The rules

**Rule 1:** Practice what you want.

**Rule 2:** Track and review what you practice.

**Rule 3:** Never work on more than 5 things at a time.

#### Practice what you want

At the risk of stating the obvious: if you hate to practice, then eventually you
_won't_. Full stop.

Practice should be at least somewhat enjoyable, but keep the following in mind:

- If practice is too hard, you'll hate practicing. If it's too easy you won't
  make progress. You must push yourself without becoming demotivated (finding
  that balance point is tricky).

- There is no point in practicing what you've already mastered _except_ for
  "mindless" warm-up drills and technique exercises. Some days I only have
  energy for "mindless" exercises.

- I try to balance the six T's: training (general/mixed topics), timing, tunes
  (repertoire), theory, technique, and tones (ear training). This isn't
  necessary every session, but strive for balance over the long haul.

- Remember that _you play what you practice._ The way you practice scales,
  triads, etc. will show up in your playing eventually. If you only practice
  scales by mechanically going up and down the scale linearly with a monotonous
  rhythm, guess how your solos will sound? If you permit fret buzzes and muted
  notes when playing chords during practice, they won't magically fix themselves
  when performing.
  
  Try to be musical with your practice. 

#### Track what you practice

The simple act of writing down what you're working on helps you focus.

It's motivational to track how much _time_ you spend practicing as well as
tracking streaks (continuous days with at least one exercise practiced).

A kitchen timer will keep you honest about time. 

Track streaks by marking a big
red X on a wall-calendar each day you practice (or use an app like
[strides](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strides-goals-habits-tracker/id672401817)
on iOS or
[loop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_US)
on Android).

**Use a metronome**. A metronome helps to not only build speed, but also to
measure progress. Remember you can use whole notes, half notes, quarter
notes, triplets, and sixteenth notes in addition to adjusting BPM!

**Record yourself**. Objectively listening to yourself is a million times easier
if you _aren't currently focused on playing_. Get in the habit of recording
yourself often. Go back and listen to old recordings periodically, too.

#### Never work on more than five things at a time

Three things at a time is even better (but hard to stick to).

Your `focus list` should change slowly, certainly no more than every several
days. If you're tired of working on something, feel free to swap it out for
anything else that interests you, but nothing feels better than taking
something off the list because you've already mastered it.

Persistence is a virtue!

## Practice vs. exercise sessions

My practice sessions are typically thirty to ninety minutes long on any given
day.

Like most people, my "practice" sessions usually comprise a few short bursts of
true, focused _practice_ interspersed with bits of noodling/playing, trying to
find my blasted tuner or favorite pick, getting coffee, searching for something
I just saw online, _etc_.

The system described here tracks these individual, focused,
"exercise-sessions" _within_ a day's practice, not the total wall-clock time I
spent in my practice area.

Each exercise-session is a short, focused burst of effort, typically just three to five
minutes long. I'll often work through more than one during a single day's
practice.

Don't feel bad about time spent noodling and goofing around! Every
minute you spend with a guitar in hand helps. It's important to enjoy your
practice time, and we _need_ recovery time between exercise-sessions. It's
impossible to sustain the intense focus required by real _practice_ for more
than a few minutes at a time.
