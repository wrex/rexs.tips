Nobody improves without practice, _regular_ practice, lots, and lots, and
**lots** of practice.
<!--more-->

The student asks, "How do I ..."

"Practice."

"But why can't I ..."

"You just need more practice."

Despite the absolute, inarguable truth of that answer, _every_ student grows frustrated with
the response. We _know_ we need more practice, but how? _What_ should we
practice? What are we doing _wrong_?! Why can't we get this when freaking [seven
year olds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJKYjXe6ACE) that can barely
barely hold a guitar make it seem effortless?

Those are popular questions: I just searched Google for "how to practice guitar" and got 211 _million_ 
results!

We all secretly want "spoon feeding" from a magic instructor genie. We want someone watching over our shoulder
as we practice to tell us _exactly_ what our problems are, where we should focus, and how to
go about fixing it.

Sadly, genies don't exist and guitar teachers charge too much by the hour for
this service. We're on our own to devise a strategy that works for us.

This _extremely_ long section documents many things I've learned about practice.

I've organized it into the four sub-sections listed below.

I won't be offended if you want to skip the rationale and just learn _how_ to
practice. If so, just jump directly to the last sub-section: [Rex's System]({{<
ref "rexs-system" >}}).

Just be forewarned: As much as I believe in the system, I still can't even begin
to play like that seven-year-old!
