TODO: break this into multiple pages

Nobody improves without practice, **regular** practice, lots, and lots, and
**lots** of practice. 

But too many people (myself included) unconsciously start to dread (and thus
avoid) their practice sessions.
<!--more-->

This _extremely_ long page documents many things I've learned about practice,
but doesn't provide much in the way of practical advice. 

If you want to skip the rationale and just learn _how_ to practice, jump directly
to [Rex's System]({{< ref "guitar/rexs-system" >}}) later in the course.

One of the biggest reasons we start to dread practice is that we see too little
improvement after too much time. We must overcome a huge motivational hurdle
to even start a session.

Let's discuss each problem in turn: [motivation](#motivation) and [time](#time).

## Motivation
It's all too easy to despair about our lack of progress on the instrument
(trust me, we've all been there).

Beginners also tend to desire "spoon feeding." We are all fundamentally lazy. We
want someone to tell us exactly what we should be working on and in what order,
every step of the way.

I've learned a few tricks that help with both issues, however.

It's important to find as many ways as possible to make practice as easy and
**pleasurable** as possible. This includes making _where_ you practice as
pleasant as possible: bright, clutter free, and someplace you want to be.

It's totally legit to bribe yourself with new toys, too: new
guitars/pedals/amp/software (or simply new strings). Anything that makes you
want to pick up the guitar is good (just try to at least recognize when you are playing
with new toys more than actually practicing).

## Time

The other huge impediment to quality practice, of course, is _time_, or, more
specifically, lack of it. None of us, rich or poor, working or retired, get more
than 24 hours in a day, and we all have things other than guitar competing for
that time.

### How much time?

My advice is to set _realistic_ expectations out the gate. It's easy to set
yourself up for failure with an aggressive time goal. Few things are as
demotivating as feeling "I'm so far behind".

Behind what? Remember that at one point you couldn't play _at all_. You're
almost always the only one setting expectations on yourself: it pays to make
them easily achievable.

Not everyone has an hour or more per day to dedicate to the guitar. Fewer
still can remain motivated while spending that much time with the instrument.

On the other hand, you're unlikely to make significant progress if you only
dedicate, say, an hour or two every third weekend. _Regular_, near-daily
practice is by far the most efficient way to improve.

The more time you can dedicate each day, of course, the faster your progress
will be, but even five minutes a day three or four times a week (hopefully with
longer periods every other weekend or so) is more than sufficient.

Five minutes a day, three days a week is roughly a bazillion times better than
thirty minutes every other weekend. (Those **must** be five by-the-clock, focused,
efficient, dedicated, distraction-free minutes each day, though!)

{{% alert title="We make time for the things we care most about" color="primary" %}}
If you can't find time to practice, then you have other things more important in
your life than learning the guitar.

That's _okay!_
{{% /alert %}}

### Time of day

Divide your typical day into three segments: morning, mid-day, evening. Ask
yourself two questions:

1. Realistically, which of these segments is more often available for me to
   practice?

2. In the absence of any other constraints, which segment would I _prefer_ to
   use for practice?

Ignore weekdays vs. weekends for the moment.

We're all different. Some have more energy in the mornings, others at night. Try
to at least be aware of when you'd _prefer_ to practice.

If other constraints make it impossible to practice during your preferred
segment, realize that any practice is better than no practice.

Next, spend a moment to think of any specific action you make almost every
single day during the time segment you choose.

Maybe it's making a cup of coffee. Maybe it's placing your car-keys in a tray or
or on a hook. Maybe it's washing the dishes after dinner. Ideally, it's
something you do almost every single day.

Try to find something where you can afford to spend an extra
minute or two on the task.

That's your trigger.

We are **not** going to associate the trigger with a full practice session.
That's way too big and too much effort.

Instead, we'll associate it with the very first step of practice: reviewing your
focus list. 

In my case, my trigger is retrieving my first cup of coffee from the coffee maker.

Every time I make coffee in the morning (my preferred segment) I retrieve my
   [Zettelkasten]({{< ref
   "guitar/rexs-system/system-components#zettelkasten">}}) and review my [focus
   list]({{< ref "guitar/rexs-system/system-components#focus-list">}}) while I
   enjoy the coffee.

That typically leads to at least a few minutes of practice. _But it doesn't
matter whether I practice or not._ All that matters is that I physically pick up
my ring of index cards like Pavlov's dog whenever I start making coffee.

Seriously: I can't fill the coffee maker any more without at least thinking about
guitar.

It's a stupid pet trick, but it works.

### The squishy nature of time

I'm going to introduce two magic tools in this section.

Earlier, I recommended "even five minutes" of practice per day. You may think
"five minutes" sounds too short to accomplish anything useful.

Far from it. In fact, five minutes can seem _tortuously_ long: I frequently
practice individual exercises for even shorter intervals (three minutes is my
preferred interval for many exercises).

But short practice sessions require 100% focus. Each interval must be focused,
active time with no distractions, snacking, or email.

#### Kitchen timer

The most effective way I know to accomplish this is with the first magic tool: a
kitchen timer.

Just looking at a wall clock _doesn't work._ The timer on your smartphone will
work in a pinch, but I recommend [an inexpensive kitchen
timer](http://amzn.com/B01D8EMXIQ).

Decide on the drill or exercise you're going to perform, set the timer for three
minutes, and go. You'll swear the bell must be broken sometimes! Three minutes
can be an _unbelievably_ long time.

I try to get in at least 20 minutes of practice most days. Some days I only have
enough time for a single 3-5 minute exercise. Other days I have time for three
or four 3-minute sprints, plus time for planning my next practice sessions. 

Even on days where I have an hour or more to dedicate, I tend to break things
into twenty minute sections with breaks in between.

Seriously, an _awful_ lot can be accomplished with just one three-minute drill a
day for three or more days per week.

#### Metronome

The other more magic tool to control time is a _metronome._

A metronome has at least three different uses:

- Most commonly, it's useful for building speed. You start practicing something
  at a slow tempo, then gradually increase the tempo when you can play through
  the exercise without mistakes.

- It's useful to subdivide a beat and feel a groove. Basically, you
  can use a metronome as a standby for an actual drummer (one that never gets
  bored).

- It's the ultimate test proctor (and reality check). You may **think** you've
  learned a lick, chord sequence, or whatever, and can play it well, but there
  is nothing like a metronome to prove just how wrong you are.

It's the last one that I'd like to focus on here, especially in conjunction
with a kitchen timer.

Let's say you're an absolute beginner, still struggling to switch between G, C,
and D chords in open position: A great way to practice is to set the timer
for three minutes, the metronome to a slow tempo (say 60 BPM) and practice
switching chords every fourth beat.

As it gets easier from session to session, day to day, try every third beat,
every second beat, or every beat. Finally, start increasing the tempo.

This works for almost any exercise.

Those beats just don't stop! It's _hard_ (and exhausting) to play something
you've not yet completely mastered in time. Believe me: three minutes can seem
an eternity with this sort of exercise.

It can be unbelievably satisfying, though, when you finally complete an exercise
without missing a beat, even if only for three minutes at a time!

## KNOWING

Like most people, I'm prone to thinking I've mastered something and am ready to
move on as soon as I understand it and can perform it *once* at a slow, shaky
tempo. 

It took me several years to realize the *degree* to which I needed to learn
things on the guitar.

I thought, for example, that once I'd memorized all five shapes of the
pentatonic scale I was *done*. Next!

Wrong, wrong, wrong.

Musicians must learn fundamentals to an almost maniacal degree. They must know
things as well as they know letters of the alphabet, the names and colors of
fruits, or the names and faces of friends and family members.

I call this **KNOWING** something (all caps and bold). Knowing is not **KNOWING**.

Just as when you hear “green” you immediately visualize the color, hearing the
note name "C&sharp;" should cause several locations on the fretboard to *light
up* in your mind's eye.

**KNOWING** means you know something back-to-front as well as front-to-back.

It means: given a note name, you can instantly, *effortlessly* find that note
all over the fretboard.

It means: after plunking a finger down anywhere on the fretboard, you instantly,
*effortlessly* know the name of the note at that location and the name of the
other notes nearby.

It's the same thing with the pentatonic scale. I thought I'd "learned the scale"
as soon as I could play each "box" on the neck.

Just memorizing "the five shapes" barely scratched the surface!

* I needed to learn which note performed what function in each position. 
* I needed to know where to _find_ each note within each "box." 
* I needed to internalize how each note *sounded* over different chords in a
  blues progression. 
* I needed to get to the point where I'd merely _think_ think "G Major
  pentatonic" to *instantly* find the closest scale shape anywhere on the neck. 
* Without conscious thought, I also needed to be able to _instantly_ switch to
  the scale for the next chord in a progression.

**KNOWING** often takes months of focused practice.

## Play vs. practice

Practice should rarely be relaxing. If you aren't pushing yourself in some way,
you probably aren't practicing. Practice takes focus and effort.

Sitting on the couch and mindlessly noodling while watching TV isn't practice,
it's playing. Noodling does provide some value (your body will get some
mechanical benefit from familiarity and constant contact/exercise on the
instrument) but without some sort of structure its inefficient at best, and it's
definitely not practice.

We all do it. But don't get confused: _playing_ isn't _practicing_ and you need
practice to improve.

Even five minutes of focus and pushing suffices for an individual practice session.

The "pushing" can be mental or it can be physical, and you should strive to
balance the two.

Don't get me wrong: Playing before or after practice (even mindless sofa
noodling) is a great thing! It's even okay to skip practice altogether some
days. 

The whole point of learning the instrument (for amateurs) is to have fun! The
more you learn the more fun you'll have, though.

Instead of feeling guilty when you bail on practice, you should reward yourself
if you even pick up the guitar on any given day. The reward can be as simple as
a beverage, a snack, or even allowing yourself a few minutes surfing the web or
watching cat videos. Whatever feels like a small reward.

Try, however, to get in at least a few minutes of focused practice in along with
your play, _almost every single day_.

Even five minutes a day for four our five days per week is **a zillion times
better** than a multi-hour marathon session every few weeks. 

## Removing impediments

Practice is a sort of mini-war: everything is constantly trying it's damnedest
to keep you from practicing. 

Your job is to eliminate every possible excuse and impediment.

Starting a practice session needs to be falling-off-a-log easy. The ideal is to
make it easier to practice than not. Anything that might create the slightest
impediment needs to go.

Examples of this kind of thinking:

- Keep your guitar out of its case on a stand or hanging on the wall.

- Maintain a dedicated practice area (just a corner of a room suffices) with
  everything you need out and ready to use: stool, guitar, timer, metronome,
  notebook, tripod, computer/tablet, etc.

- Pre-cable and configure everything so that a single "on" switch will power
  everything up and leave you ready to go.

You're a million times less likely to even start a practice session If you need
to unpack anything, flip more than one switch, plug in more than one cable, or
if you need to root around to find a pen and paper to write on. 

It's _way_ too easy to blow off a practice session for the silliest little
impediment!

One caution: while I **do** recommend keeping a computer or tablet nearby,
beware of the distractions they can become. In particular, **if there is any way
to turn off notifications and alerts during your practice session, do so.**

Fight the desire to surf the web or check email &mdash; that's not practice!

## Bite-sized chunks

We engineers tend to be a bit obsessive. Once we set ourselves to a
task, we focus on it almost to the exclusion of everything else. Worse, we tend
to set absurdly over-aggressive goals. 

Without actually saying out loud or writing it down, we'll think something as
silly as:

> "I want to learn to play [some song]. I'll keep practicing until it sounds
> _exactly_ like the record."

Then we'll mono-maniacally practice that and only that for the next several
days, weeks, or months until we succeed or (more likely) are ready to give up
the instrument.

Baby steps prove to be about a million times more motivating. Instead of
setting the bar at _mastering an entire song as well as a professional_ (!!) how
about:

* Identify the various sections of the song (intro, verses, choruses, outro,
  etc.).

* Figure out what key the song is in.

* Learn the guitar riff in bars six and seven.

* _etc_.

The trick is to make each "chunk" manageable but _measurable_. Nothing is as
motivating as seeing measurable progress. (Conversely, nothing is as
**demotivating** as seeing little to no progress on an "impossible" goal.)

Break "impossible" things down into smaller things you _know_ you can accomplish! 

## Balance

Normal people tend to _hate_ music theory. Engineers like myself tend to go the
other way. We obsess about "why?!"

I can speak at length about some fairly advanced topics in musical theory, but
I'm _embarrassingly_ less accomplished on the instrument than people that "learned
everything by ear" and have only been playing for a short while!

It's best to _balance_ your practice sessions and gradually improve in several
areas than it is to mono-maniacally focus on one thing.

One useful trick for balancing your practice is to categorize individual
exercises into one of six categories, what I call:

### The six T's

{{% alert color="info" %}}

<img src="/svg/training.svg" style="width: 1rem; height: 1rem;" > &ensp; Training
(default)

<img src="/svg/tunes.svg" style="width: 1rem; height: 1rem;" > &ensp; Tunes
(repertoire)

<img src="/svg/theory.svg" style="width: 1rem; height: 1rem;" > &ensp; Theory (book
learnining)

<img src="/svg/technique.svg" style="width: 1rem; height: 1rem;" > &ensp; Technique
(dexterity and "chops")

<img src="/svg/timing.svg" style="width: 1rem; height: 1rem;" > &ensp; Timing (rhythm &
groove)

<img src="/svg/tones.svg" style="width: 1rem; height: 1rem;" > &ensp; Tones (ear-training)
{{% /alert %}}

Ideally, you'd like to balance your practice across all six categories (over the
long haul, not for each practice session!).

Most exercises fall into the default "Training" category, either because they
are hard to categorize, or overlap several categories fairly equally.

Other items clearly fall into just one the remaining categories:

Tunes are what it's all about. They are exercises that synthesize all you've
learned to play actual songs.

Theory means the fundamental concepts that help us think about and discuss
music with others (concepts like harmony and the circle of fifths). Most
"theory" exercises will involve rote memorization.

Technique is for exercises that _primarily_ improve your manual dexterity. Not
necessarily musical exercises, but things like "spider" exercises to improve
finger independence.

Timing is for drills that focus almost exclusively on your internal sense of
rhythm.

Lastly, tones are exercises that focus exclusively on ear training.

### What _not_ to do

Let's say for example that you'd like to learn the song [Blackbird by the
Beatles](https://www.guitardownunder.com/_scores/blackbird.pdf).

The mono-maniacal approach would be to find the tab, start at bar 1 every session for
weeks on end, play from the beginning until you make a mistake, then restart
from the beginning.

After several weeks, you'll inevitably find that you've practiced the first few
bars umpteen bazillion times but have yet to reach the end of the song!

It's a terrible way to practice, but sadly it's also terribly common.

Far, far better would be to set a schedule for yourself and force yourself to
stick to it. Break the song up into bite-sized sections: maybe bars 1-4 during
the first session, 5-8 the next, and so on (there are 35 bars in the tab linked
to above). **It's okay, even preferable, to learn the easiest bits first!**

If nothing else, practicing different bars out of order helps you give equal
time to every section (unlike always starting from the beginning). After getting
through the whole song _once_, you'll know which sections are most difficult and where
to spend the bulk of your practice time.

The idea is to practice what you _don't_ know and what you find difficult,
**not to keep practicing what you already know**! Sounds obvious, but our brains
and bodies are sneaky and lazy: they don't like to be pushed and will always try
to go back to what they find easiest.

Even better is to break up and extend your practice sessions using the six T's.
In addition to just learning the Tune, add some relevant things from the other
T's:

* For technique practice you might want to spend some time on fingerpicking in
  general (dexterity exercises or whatever).

* For theory you may want to figure out the chords in the harmonized G Major
  scale (the song's in G) or figure out why there's an A7 (a major chord) in bar
  5 even though the diatonic chord in the key of G Major is A minor.

* For ear training, you probably want to ignore the tab altogether and _attempt
  to transcribe the song by ear_, baby step by baby step. 
  
  Put on the record, pausing occasionally to see if you can figure out the key,
  some of the chords, or any of the intervals and melodies that Paul is
  playing. _One bar at a time_.

Some days you may only work on one of the T's, others may touch on all of them.

The point is to attack the higher level goal ("learn the song") from multiple
angles in bite-sized chunks, and _not_ wasting time practicing what you already
know. You'll make better progress, and what you learn will be applicable to the
rest of your playing. 

You should find the whole process far less frustrating.

## Squirrel!

Distractions are a common problem.

These days, the internet makes it even worse: between online videos, ebooks,
websites, apps, remote-learning, etc., there are now so many great sources of
(often free) music education that you can literally waste _hours_ just bouncing
from topic to topic and instructor to instructor.

I don't know about you, but my practice sessions are **doomed** if I even touch
a keyboard!

{{% figproc "distractions" "Resize" "600x" %}}{{% /figproc %}}

Your phone is almost as bad (though there are so many useful apps it's hard to
avoid them altogether).

The problem is almost as bad _between_ practice sessions. I come across
fascinating new lessons, exercises, backing tracks, _etc_. almost daily! I
used to make a note somewhere (often just adding it to my "watch later" queue)
and tell myself I'd get to it eventually.

Then when it came time to sit down and practice, I'd forget what I wanted to
practice! I'd spend minutes or even hours searching through notes and watching
videos until something interested me enough to actually start practicing.

How to avoid becoming overwhelmed like this?

## Rex's system

After countless false starts, I've finally come up with what I call [Rex's
System]({{< ref "guitar/rexs-system" >}}).

At its heart, it's just three things:

1. An [exercise library]({{< ref "guitar/rexs-system/system-components#exercise-library" >}})
2. Handwritten notes on index cards (my [Zettelkasten]({{< ref
   "guitar/rexs-system/system-components#zettelkasten">}}))
3. One note in particular contains my current [focus list]({{< ref
   "guitar/rexs-system/system-components#focus-list" >}}) (the five or fewer
   exercises I'm currently focused on)

Every time I stumble across something new and interesting online, I add one or
more items to my [exercise library]({{< ref
"guitar/rexs-system/system-components#exercise-library" >}}).

If it's particularly interesting, I'll replace one of the items on my [focus
list]({{< ref "guitar/rexs-system/system-components#focus-list" >}}).

To keep myself _focused_, I force myself to keep five or fewer items on my
[focus list]({{< ref "guitar/rexs-system/system-components#focus-list" >}}). Any
more than that and I have a hard time deciding what to practice on any given day.

I still let myself watch whatever videos and read whatever content I want. If
something seems worthwhile, I'll add a link to it from my library. 

But before I take up any valuable practice time with the latest cool video or
whatever, I first look at my [focus list]({{< ref
"guitar/rexs-system/system-components#focus-list" >}}) and ask myself if the new
thing seems more important or valuable than everything already there.

Sometimes I realize I've already mastered something on the list,
so I feel no guilt about replacing it with the new thing. Other times, an item on
the list no longer "sparks joy" as Marie Kondo would say, so I drop it and put
the new thing in its place.

Usually, though, I realize I've already got plenty to work on, so I just
add the link to my library and relax knowing I won't forget about it and will
get to it eventually.

Neither my focus list nor my exercise library are in **any** sort of priority
order &mdash; I work on what I want when I want.

## Positive reinforcement

We are all prey to negative thoughts: "I suck, and I'm just not getting any
better."

Progress can be so slow sometimes that you aren't even aware you're
improving.

_Attitude_ is incredibly important. You really shouldn't let those thoughts creep
in. One thing that helps is to celebrate your successes, no matter how trivial.

### Habit tracking

This sounds like the silliest "_kumbaya,_" self-help crapola imaginable (exactly the
kind of thing engineers despise) but it really is a useful "brain hack" to
celebrate _mere attendance_.

Post a multi-month calendar somewhere near your practice area, and every single
day you practice _at all_, even for just a few minutes, put a big red X through
that day.

Believe it or not, it really works. Your brain gets the tiniest little hit of
dopamine every time you cross out another day. You get surprisingly competitive
with yourself, too, not wanting to break a continuous streak. It will start
to bother you if you see more than a day or two without a big red X.

Seriously, this one stupid human trick increased the regularity of my practice
more than anything else I've done.

These days, I've started tracking my streaks with the
[strides](https://www.stridesapp.com) app on my phone instead of using a wall
calendar. I just say, "Hey, Siri, log guitar practice" out loud whenever I start
a practice session. There are similar apps for Android like
[loop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_US).

### Recording yourself

One other positive reinforcement is to **record yourself** performing different
songs or exercises periodically.

Trust me: The first time you listen to a recording you just made, every instinct
in your body will scream out to delete it as quickly as possible! Try to ignore
the instinct and hang onto it as long as possible.

Every now and then play back an older recording, the older the better.

It's incredibly easy to lose sight of your progress. Improvements
arrive slowly via small, incremental gains. But recordings just don't lie.

Shortly after writing this, I pulled out my phone and played some of my old
recordings. Most of them were pretty laughable &mdash; I've improved
considerably. 

Some of the actual songs I'd recorded, though, surprised me the other way. I've
since forgotten how to play those songs, and my playing sounded far better to me
now than I remembered it sounding when I recorded it. Sometimes you need a
little distance to evaluate things. That's also a motivation win!



## Defining proficiency

Most drills and exercises in books, videos, or online courses only explain how
to perform a particular drill. If they mention when to stop practicing at
all, it's usually some sort of totally subjective guidance.

The problem is that while they are prescriptive ("Do this, then do that") they
are usually *open-ended*: "Keep going until you think you've got it down."

I'm just a novice, how can I judge whether I've mastered something sufficiently?

I now try to create *tests* rather than completely open-ended *exercises* as
often as possible. I wanted *objective* pass criteria, not fuzzy, subjective
self-evaluation.

### Applying test driven development

I decided to borrow a technique from software developers called "test driven
development" or TDD.

Software developers using TDD write tests *first*, and only then begin coding
the actual implementation.

The TDD process follows a cycle.

1. First write a test and a "stub" implementation (that compiles but doesn't
   actually do anything).

2. **Red Light**. Initially, the tests fail (with a "red" message). They know
   the code doesn't work yet, so they expect the test to fail.

2. **Green Light**. The developer codes the simplest possible implementation
   that makes the test pass ("green" light). The code is usually pretty ugly and
   slow at this point.

3. **Refactor**. The developer then makes changes to the code ("refactoring") to
   make it more readable, maintainable, efficient, and fast. They re-run the
   tests as they make changes to ensure the code still works. They can be
   confident their changes haven't broken the code if the light remains green.

While the field of software development is obviously quite different from
playing guitar, there are some ideas from TDD we can apply to practicing guitar.

The most important idea is to explicitly define what makes the light turn green
**before you start practicing**. In other words, document precisely what it
takes to know when you've practiced enough.

### TDG: Proficiency tests

As often as possible, I try to add *proficiency tests* to my exercise library
rather than mere exercises. In other words, I try to pre-define "mastery" for
the exercise (knowing full well that the first several attempts with an exercise
will cause a "red light").

A *proficiency test* expressly defines what constitutes a "green light" for a
particular exercise or drill.

How to make the pass criteria objective rather than subjective? Mostly with **Mr.
Metronome.**

Most people think a metronome only has two purposes:

* It provides a steady pulse during practice to improve your internal sense of timing.
* It lets you build speed by practicing at higher and higher BPM.

Both are true, but a metronome also excels as an objective, and *cruel*, task master.

Imagine teaching a child to recite the alphabet. At some point, the kid can
probably make it all the way from A to Z successfully, but with lots of "umms"
and "errs" dispersed throughout. The kid smiles in relief and thinks she's done.

With an evil grin, her teacher then say, "Congrats, Kid. You've memorized your
ABCs, now comes the hard part."

Teacher then sets a metronome to, say, 80 BPM and says, "Every time this clicks
I want you to say the next letter of the alphabet, but you can't miss a click!"

Suddenly reciting the alphabet got a whole lot harder.

*That* is how you use the metronome to objectively measure proficiency.

I won't pretend that every guitar exercise "green light" can be defined with a
metronome setting, but it does suffice for a surprising number of exercises.
