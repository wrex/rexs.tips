One of the biggest reasons we start to dread practice is that we see too little
improvement despite spending so much time practicing. The dread becomes a huge
motivational hurdle to even start a session.

Let's discuss each problem in turn.

## Motivation

It's all too easy to despair about our lack of progress on the instrument
(trust me, we've all been there).

It's important to find as many ways as possible to make practice as easy and
**pleasurable** as possible. This includes making _where_ you practice as
pleasant as possible: bright, clutter free, and someplace you want to be.

It's totally legit to bribe yourself with new toys, too: new
guitars/pedals/amp/software (or simply new strings). Anything that makes you
want to pick up the guitar is good (just try to at least recognize when you are playing
with new toys more than actually practicing).

If you feel yourself starting to dread practice, please apply some of the
[strategies]({{< ref "strategies.md" >}}) described in the next section.

## Time

The other huge impediment to quality practice, of course, is _time_, or, more
specifically, lack of it. None of us, rich or poor, working or retired, get more
than 24 hours in a day, and we all have things other than guitar competing for
that time.

### How much time?

My advice is to set _realistic_ expectations out the gate. It's easy to set
yourself up for failure with an aggressive time goal. Few things are as
demotivating as feeling "I'm so far behind".

Behind what? Remember that at one point you couldn't play _at all_. You're
almost always the only one setting expectations on yourself: it pays to make
them easily achievable.

Not everyone has an hour or more per day to dedicate to the guitar. Fewer
still can remain motivated while spending that much time with the instrument.

On the other hand, you're unlikely to make significant progress if you only
dedicate, say, an hour or two every third weekend. _Regular_, near-daily
practice is by far the most efficient way to improve.

The more time you can dedicate each day, of course, the faster your progress
will be, but even five minutes a day three or four times a week (hopefully with
longer periods every other weekend or so) is more than sufficient.

Five minutes a day, three days a week is roughly a bazillion times better than
thirty minutes every other weekend. (Those **must** be five by-the-clock, focused,
efficient, dedicated, distraction-free minutes each day, though!)

If you can't find time to practice, then you have other things more important in
your life than learning the guitar.

That's _okay!_

### Time of day

Divide your typical day into three segments: morning, mid-day, evening. Ask
yourself two questions:

1. Realistically, which of these segments is more often available for me to
   practice?

2. In the absence of any other constraints, which segment would I _prefer_ to
   use for practice?

Ignore weekdays vs. weekends for the moment.

We're all different. Some have more energy in the mornings, others at night. Try
to at least be aware of when you'd _prefer_ to practice.

If other constraints make it impossible to practice during your preferred
segment, realize that any practice is better than no practice.

Next, spend a moment to think of any specific action you make almost every
single day during the time segment you choose.

Maybe it's making a cup of coffee. Maybe it's placing your car-keys in a tray or
or on a hook. Maybe it's washing the dishes after dinner. Ideally, it's
something you do almost every single day.

Try to find something where you can afford to spend an extra
minute or two on the task.

That's your trigger.

We are **not** going to associate the trigger with a full practice session.
That's way too big and too much effort.

Instead, we'll associate it with the very first step of practice: reviewing your
focus list. 

In my case, my trigger is retrieving my first cup of coffee from the coffee maker.

Every time I make coffee in the morning (my preferred segment) I retrieve my
   [Zettelkasten]({{< ref
   "guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice/rexs-system/system-components#zettelkasten">}}) and review my [focus
   list]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice/rexs-system/system-components#focus-list">}}) while I
   enjoy the coffee.

That typically leads to at least a few minutes of practice. _But it doesn't
matter whether I practice or not._ All that matters is that I physically pick up
my ring of index cards like Pavlov's dog whenever I start making coffee.

Seriously: I can't fill the coffee maker any more without at least thinking about
guitar.

It's a stupid pet trick, but it works.

### The squishy nature of time

I'm going to introduce two magic tools in this section.

Earlier, I recommended "even five minutes" of practice per day. You may think
"five minutes" sounds too short to accomplish anything useful.

Far from it. In fact, five minutes can seem _tortuously_ long: I frequently
practice individual exercises for even shorter intervals (three minutes is my
preferred interval for many exercises).

But short practice sessions require 100% focus. Each interval must be focused,
active time with no distractions, snacking, or email.

#### Kitchen timer

The most effective way I know to accomplish this is with the first magic tool: a
kitchen timer.

Just looking at a wall clock _doesn't work._ The timer on your smartphone will
work in a pinch, but I recommend [an inexpensive kitchen
timer](http://amzn.com/B01D8EMXIQ).

Decide on the drill or exercise you're going to perform, set the timer for three
minutes, and go. You'll swear the bell must be broken sometimes! Three minutes
can be an _unbelievably_ long time.

I try to get in at least 20 minutes of practice most days. Some days I only have
enough time for a single 3-5 minute exercise. Other days I have time for three
or four 3-minute sprints, plus time for planning my next practice sessions. 

Even on days where I have an hour or more to dedicate, I tend to break things
into twenty minute sections with breaks in between.

Seriously, an _awful_ lot can be accomplished with just one three-minute drill a
day for three or more days per week.

#### Metronome

The other more magic tool to control time is a _metronome._

A metronome has at least three different uses:

- Most commonly, it's useful for building speed. You start practicing something
  at a slow tempo, then gradually increase the tempo when you can play through
  the exercise without mistakes.

- It's useful to subdivide a beat and feel a groove. Basically, you
  can use a metronome as a standby for an actual drummer (one that never gets
  bored).

- It's the ultimate test proctor (and reality check). You may **think** you've
  learned a lick, chord sequence, or whatever, and can play it well, but there
  is nothing like a metronome to prove just how wrong you are.

It's the last one that I'd like to focus on here, especially in conjunction
with a kitchen timer.

Let's say you're an absolute beginner, still struggling to switch between G, C,
and D chords in open position: A great way to practice is to set the timer
for three minutes, the metronome to a slow tempo (say 60 BPM) and practice
switching chords every fourth beat.

As it gets easier from session to session, day to day, try every third beat,
every second beat, or every beat. Finally, start increasing the tempo.

This works for almost any exercise.

Those beats just don't stop! It's _hard_ (and exhausting) to play something
you've not yet completely mastered in time. Believe me: three minutes can seem
an eternity with this sort of exercise.

It can be unbelievably satisfying, though, when you finally complete an exercise
without missing a beat, even if only for three minutes at a time!

 

## Removing impediments

Practice is a sort of mini-war: everything is constantly trying it's damnedest
to keep you from practicing. 

Your job is to eliminate every possible excuse and impediment.

Starting a practice session needs to be falling-off-a-log easy. The ideal is to
make it easier to practice than not. Anything that might create the slightest
impediment needs to go.

Examples of this kind of thinking:

- Keep your guitar out of its case on a stand or hanging on the wall.

- Maintain a dedicated practice area (just a corner of a room suffices) with
  everything you need out and ready to use: stool, guitar, timer, metronome,
  notebook, tripod, computer/tablet, etc.

- Pre-cable and configure everything so that a single "on" switch will power
  everything up and leave you ready to go.

You're a million times less likely to even start a practice session If you need
to unpack anything, flip more than one switch, plug in more than one cable, or
if you need to root around to find a pen and paper to write on. 

It's _way_ too easy to blow off a practice session for the silliest little
impediment!

One caution: while I **do** recommend keeping a computer or tablet nearby,
beware of the distractions they can become. In particular, **if there is any way
to turn off notifications and alerts during your practice session, do so.**

Fight the desire to surf the web or check email &mdash; that's not practice!

## Bite-sized chunks

We engineers tend to be a bit obsessive. Once we set ourselves to a
task, we focus on it almost to the exclusion of everything else. Worse, we tend
to set absurdly over-aggressive goals. 

Without actually saying out loud or writing it down, we'll think something as
silly as:

> "I want to learn to play [some song]. I'll keep practicing until it sounds
> _exactly_ like the record."

Then we'll mono-maniacally practice that and only that for the next several
days, weeks, or months until we succeed or (more likely) are ready to give up
the instrument.

Baby steps prove to be about a million times more motivating. Instead of
setting the bar at _mastering an entire song as well as a professional_ (!!) how
about:

* Identify the various sections of the song (intro, verses, choruses, outro,
  etc.).

* Figure out what key the song is in.

* Learn the guitar riff in bars six and seven.

* _etc_.

The trick is to make each "chunk" manageable but _measurable_. Nothing is as
motivating as seeing measurable progress. (Conversely, nothing is as
**demotivating** as seeing little to no progress on an "impossible" goal.)

Break "impossible" things down into smaller things you _know_ you can accomplish! 



## Squirrel!

Distractions are a common problem.

These days, the internet makes it even worse: between online videos, ebooks,
websites, apps, remote-learning, etc., there are now so many great sources of
(often free) music education that you can literally waste _hours_ just bouncing
from topic to topic and instructor to instructor.

I don't know about you, but my practice sessions are **doomed** if I even touch
a keyboard!

Your phone is almost as bad (though there are so many useful apps it's hard to
avoid them altogether).

The problem is almost as bad _between_ practice sessions. I come across
fascinating new lessons, exercises, backing tracks, _etc_. almost daily! I
used to make a note somewhere (often just adding it to my "watch later" queue)
and tell myself I'd get to it eventually.

Then when it came time to sit down and practice, I'd forget what I wanted to
practice! I'd spend minutes or even hours searching through notes and watching
videos until something interested me enough to actually start practicing.

How to avoid becoming overwhelmed like this?
