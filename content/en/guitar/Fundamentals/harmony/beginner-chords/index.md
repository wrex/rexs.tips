In addition to [knowing the notes on the fretboard]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/notes" >}}) every beginning guitarist needs to be competent at playing basic open-position major chords (the "cowboy chords").


The proficiency test for this page is {{< tdgref "beginner-chords" >}}

{{< youtube yGAtYO0VMsA  >}}

The goal is to become proficient playing at least one shape of every major chord in open position (ignoring roots with flats and sharps).

Here are the seven "cowboy chords":

{{< figproc "cowboy-chords" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

Even beginners should be familiar with these chord shapes. Please refer to a beginner guitar site if you are just getting started with guitar. You'll be hard pressed to find a better one than [Justin Sandercoe's](https://www.justinguitar.com/categories/beginner-guitar-lessons-grade-1).

Practice playing each of those chord shapes individually as well as moving
between them. When you feel ready, see if you can make it through
{{< tdgref "beginner-chords" >}} without any mistakes.

With just these seven chords you can accompany thousands of songs. They will get play any I-IV-V progression in a major "guitar key" (the keys of E, A, D, G, and C major).

Have fun!
