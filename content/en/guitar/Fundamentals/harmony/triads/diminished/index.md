Diminished triads aren't nearly as important as major and minor, but they are built using octave drops in the same fashion.

{{< figproc "C-diminished-arpeggios" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

First complete the diminished arpeggio test:

{{< tdgalert "triads/dim-arpeggios" >}}
This is the proficiency test for diminished arpeggios.
{{< /tdgalert >}}

Next, practice playing diminished triads on each successive string set. Refer to [figure 1](#C-diminished-arpeggios) as necessary.

{{< tdgalert "triads/dim-gbe" >}}
{{< /tdgalert >}}
{{< tdgalert "triads/dim-dgb" >}}
{{< /tdgalert >}}
{{< tdgalert "triads/dim-adg" >}}
{{< /tdgalert >}}
{{< tdgalert "triads/dim-ead" >}}
{{< /tdgalert >}}

Finally, practice finding *different* minor triads along the GBE and DGB string sets.

{{< tdgalert "triads/dim-top4" >}}
Proficiency test for finding minor triads along GBE <em>and</em> DGB.
