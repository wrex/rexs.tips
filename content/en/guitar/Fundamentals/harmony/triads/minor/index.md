We can speed up a little with the remaining triad types and jump right to the full six-string arpeggios. They are built using octave drops in the same way as Major triads.

{{< figproc "C-minor-arpeggios" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

First complete the minor arpeggio test:

{{< tdgalert "triads/minor-arpeggios" />}}

Next, practice playing minor triads on each successive string set. Refer to [figure 1](#C-minor-arpeggios) as necessary.

{{< tdgalert "triads/min-gbe" />}}
{{< tdgalert "triads/min-dgb" />}}
{{< tdgalert "triads/min-adg" />}}
{{< tdgalert "triads/min-ead" />}}

Finally, practice finding *different* minor triads along the GBE and DGB string sets.

{{< tdgalert "triads/min-top4" />}}
