Music comprises just three things:

1. [Notes]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/notes" >}}) (or melody)

2. [Harmony]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/harmony" >}}) (chords)

3. [Rhythm]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/rhythm" >}})

This section provides a fundamental introduction to all three, and is the basis
for everything else in this guide, but if you are an absolute beginner on the
guitar, I **strongly** suggest you first go through a beginner's course
elsewhere.

I think [Justin's new for 2020 beginner guitar
course](https://www.justinguitar.com/categories/beginner-guitar-lessons-grade-1)
is probably the best and most complete beginner course out there.

Before getting too deep into theory, I attempt to pass on a bit of advice
about [how to practice]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/how-to-practice" >}}).

In the [section on notes]({{< ref "/guitar/Fundamentals/notes" >}}) we will
first review some [fundamental theory]({{< ref
"/guitar/Fundamentals/notes/just-12-notes.md" >}}) (the diatonic and chromatic
scales in particular). Then I provide some practical lessons for [learning the
notes on the fretboard]({{< ref "/guitar/Fundamentals/notes/finding-notes" >}}).

In [rhythm]({{< ref "/guitar/Fundamentals/rhythm" >}}) we'll introduce the
ultimate task master: the metronome. We'll also discuss some more fun topics
like syncopation and "flat tire" rhythms.

Lastly, in [harmony]({{< ref "/guitar/Fundamentals/harmony" >}}) we'll discuss
the most basic chords: triads.

Each section has a collection of proficiency tests to help you practice and
master the material.
