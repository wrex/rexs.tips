<p>
  I wrote the guitar related content on this site primarily for my own benefit. 
</p>
<p>
  Maintaining these pages has helped clarify my own thinking. It's at least
  conceptually possible that others might find the content useful as well.
</p>
<p>
  I created this site for one  of my closest friends who, like myself, is an
  engineer that can't help but ask "why?" at every turn. Please understand that
  I'm still an intermediate player at best &mdash; those that can't
  &ldquo;do,&rdquo; teach.
</p>
<p>
  While I've tried to succinctly answer "why" at each step, I've learned that too
  much &ldquo;book learning&rdquo; can get in the way of actually playing the
  instrument. So I've also tried hard to make the content procedural and
  prescriptive wherever possible. Trust me, it's easy to get lost in the weeds.
