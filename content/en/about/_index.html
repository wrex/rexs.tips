Most of what's written here is for my own benefit.

Caution and skepticism are warranted.

<p>
  Most of the content on this site is about learning to play the guitar.
  Maintaining these pages has helped clarify my own thinking. It's at least
  conceptually possible that others might find the content useful as well.
</p>
<p>
  I created this site for one  of my closest friends who, like myself, is an
  engineer that can't help but ask "why?" at every turn. Please understand that
  I'm still an intermediate player at best &mdash; those that can't
  &ldquo;do,&rdquo; teach.
</p>
<p>
  While I've tried to succinctly answer "why" at each step, I've learned that too
  much &ldquo;book learning&rdquo; can get in the way of actually playing the
  instrument. So I've also tried hard to make the content procedural and
  prescriptive wherever possible. Trust me, it's easy to get lost in the weeds.

    In addition to playing the guitar, my other hobbies include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Machining, metalworking, and machine tool reconditioning</li>
    <li>Making all sorts of things (including guitars) out of wood, metal, and plastic</li>
    <li>The Asian game of Go/Baduk/Wei Qi</li>
    <li>The Japanese language and culture</li>
