Here's some of the changes I'm planning for the new site:

<!--more-->

Firstly, I expect to have categories of information in my [blog]({{< ref "/blog" >}}). BI will only publish "sitewide" news to the [news section]({{< ref "/blog/news" >}}). Use the navigation on the left to view content in different categories.

More importantly, I'm re-organizing and moving all of my lesson oriented guitar content to [its own section]({{< ref "/guitar" >}}). It's probably worth bookmarking [{{< ref "/guitar" >}}]({{< ref "/guitar" >}}) separately from the homepage or my [blog]({{< ref "/blog" >}}) if you find yourself going there frequently.

I'm hopeful that navigation will be quite a bit easier.

{{< alert title="Warning" >}}
The new site also includes "alerts" colored boxes for tips, info, etc. Sometimes the admonitions will be fully expanded (like this one). Other times only the header bar will be visible and you will need to click the button to expand the contents. Different admonition types are different colors and have different icons.
{{< /alert >}}

I'm in the process of bringing over all the old content, one page at a time, making edits and improvements as I go. It will take quite a while, but I've wanted to re-organize the content and shorten things for quite a while.

I'm tightening up (shortening!) most of the posts. Almost all of them were too long with a lot of redundancy. I'm trying hard to "kill my darlings."

It will take me quite a while to move everything over, but I'll start with the most important bits. Re-used content will keep the date of the original posting, any new content will, of course, be dated after March, 2020.

I'm also hoping to introduce a new idea in the guitar section: "test driven guitar".

With every "lesson" page, I hope to include one or more drills to let you know when you've mastered a topic sufficiently. I haven't yet decided how I will style these "TDG drills".

In addition to drills on each "lesson" post, I'm planning to create "Learning tracks": ordered lists of drills and their associated posts. A "beginner" track, for example will have tests for learning the notes, playing basic chords, practicing with a metronome, etc.

Eventually (hopefully soon) I want to allow users of the site to track their progress with the TDG drills (with states of "not started," "in progress," or "completed"). This requires logins and some sort of stateful API, however, so at least for some period of time each user will just have to keep track of their own progress.

Lastly, while this theme includes support for playing audio, it's oriented more for commercial song playing (on Chinese services). I'm probably going to use [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com) or something similar that's better sorted for the sort of audio content I expect on this site.
