I've been making tremendous progress in moving over content from the old site.

Before moving the individual blog posts, I wanted to move the "Resource" section over to [OMFG]({{< ref "/guitar" >}}). What was "Learning the fretboard" is now [Fundamentals/notes]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/notes" >}}). What was "Triads" is now [Fundamentals/harmony]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/harmony" >}}).

I think the new organization is much, *much* better. I'm particularly happy with how the proficiency tests are turning out!

I need to create some new content for [Fundamentals/rhythm]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/rhythm" >}}) before tackling all the blues and pentatonics stuff from old blog posts, but I'm getting dangerously close to retiring the old site.

I'm pretty sure I'll have all the original content moved over and the old site retired before the end of next week.

Enjoy!
