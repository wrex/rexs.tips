I've *finally* happy with my [treatise on how to learn the notes on the fretboard]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/notes" >}}).

I've been working on that document over three different forms of this website, and have spent countless hours working on it. I'm quite happy with how it turned out. I hope it proves useful for someone!

For anyone that's seen previous versions, I think you'll find this much better organized (and hopefully better written). The [proficiency tests]({{< ref "guitar/tests/learn-neck" >}}) really work, and I like having the exercises/tests split out separately from the tutorial itself.

Please let me know what you think!
