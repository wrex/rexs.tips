What's sweet without savoury? Light without dark? Happy without sad?

Moving one note in a chord has a *profound* effect. Let's investigate the sadder side of harmony.

We will eventually discuss triads (three note chords) in depth in other posts on this site, but here is a bare bones introduction.

Triads are built out of intervals. Specifically, they are built out of intervals of *a third*.

There are two types of third intervals: minor and major thirds. A minor third is found three semitones (three frets) higher than a reference note. A major third is found four semitones higher.

That half-step difference affects the sound of the chord **profoundly**.

Let's take the major chords [we learned in the last lesson]({{< ref "/2020-03-20-barre-chords.md" >}}) and turn them into minor chords:

Notice how the Em and Am shapes just lower one note (the third) a single fret.

The Dm shape also lowers the third a fret, but doubles that note an octave lower in the bass (instead of playing the root in the bass as we did with the major shape).

For reasons we won't get into here, every key has three major chords and three minor chords. (Each key also has a diminished chord, but we'll ignore that for now).

The chords in the key of G Major are:

* G major
* A minor
* B minor
* C Major
* D Major
* E minor
* (F&sharp; diminished)

In C Major, they are:

* C Major
* D minor
* E minor
* F Major
* G Major
* A minor
* (B diminished)

In F major, they are:

* F Major
* G minor
* A minor
* B&flat; Major
* C Major
* D minor
* (E diminished)

Play the "harmonized scale" for the keys of G, C, and F (skipping the diminished chord in each scale). You are free to choose any shape for each chord, but try to consciously use all three shapes.

In the key of G, for example, you'll first play G Major somewhere on the neck, followed by A minor, then B minor, etc., continuing through to E minor.

**Remember this pattern!** Major, minor, minor, Major, Major, minor. Giving roman numerals to each chord:

* I, IV, and V are Major chords
* ii, iii, and vi are minor chords

(The convention is to use upper case roman numerals for Major chords, and lowercase for minor. We will be discussing this pattern in much more detail later.)

Pass criteria: You can play a harmonized scale with half notes at 60 BPM without hesitation or flubbed notes.
