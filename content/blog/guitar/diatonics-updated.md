I just pushed a **massive** rewrite of the [diatonic theory]({{< ref "/guitar/Getting-started/notes/just-12-notes.md" >}}) page.

The new [Docsy](https://docsy.dev) theme with it's orientation toward documentation (vs. a typical blog) really helped. Stupid as it sounds, it was a bit of an epiphany to realize I wanted to publish both blog-oriented and book-oriented content.

I can now publish content in a more hierarchal, ordered format without being constrained to things showing up in date order.

Eventually, https://rexs.tips/guitar should turn into a full-blown multi-media book of sorts.

A few things to note:

* I've re-ordered and re-written most of the content on the diatonic theory page. Its still pretty long, despite removing a bunch of stuff (some of which will get moved to pages on chords and harmony.)

* If your browser window is wide enough (on a desktop) you should see a table of contents on the right.

* Again on a big screen, you should also see links on the right to create "issues" as well as actually edit the page directly on github (if you have permissions).

* If you hover over any section heading, you'll see a "link" icon to remind you that you can link directly to that part of the page (named anchors).

* I expect to add sections on "rhythm" and "harmony" to the Getting Started section.

* I will eventually port over *all* of the content from the [original site](https://lessons.doiwalters.com).

Enjoy!
