Like every guitarist, I want to get better at soloing. The fundamental pre-requisite to soloing is **KNOWING** at least one scale all over the neck.
<!--more-->

It's traditional to start with pentatonic (5 note) scales. It's easier for students to memorize and learn how to use five notes than it is to learn seven (as contained in full diatonic scales).

I'm going to break with tradition, though, and start with the blues scale, which is the pentatonic scale with one extra note. I believe that adding that one extra note provides a "hook" for your brain. It makes it easier to **KNOW** which *note* your playing, rather than simply memorizing shapes.

Note that I'm calling it "**the** blues scale" or "**the** pentatonic scale". As we'll see in later posts, there are really two flavors of each: minor and major. The only difference is which note you consider the root &mdash; the shapes are the same. When it matters, I'll call out whether I'm referring to a major or minor scale.

This post is simply to introduce the mother of all scale exercises. And it's a mother, believe me. If you find this exercise too advanced to even get started, please don't get disheartened, just wait for me to post further stepping stone posts. As always we're starting with the *end* TDG exercise that we are aiming for.

As difficult as you'll probably find it, please stick with it. It *is* possible to get fluent at this. Like anything it just takes practice. Weeks and weeks and weeks of practice.

Proficiency with this one exercise pays off unbelievably. If you can perform this exercise with any fluidity, you can absolutely solo over the changes to pretty much any song, especially blues, country, or rock songs.

This exercise may be performed rubato, without a metronome.

I've used Am as an example below.

1. Find the lowest fully fretted scale position on the neck. For Am, this is box 5. Now do the following:

    Starting on the lowest root note in the position, play ascending notes to the highest note in the position

    Next, back up and play descending to the lowest note.

    Then ascend again until you hit the lowest root note. It's important in this step to always begin and end the ascending/descending run on the root note. This helps to get the *sound* of the scale in your head.

    In other words, for Am you'd play A on the 6th string, ascend to A on the first string, descend all the way to G on the 3rd fret of the 6th string, then play the A at the 5th fret again.

    Finally, play the triad shape(s) for that position on the top three or four strings, visualizing how the the chord(s) sit within the scale shape.

    Am box 5 sits mostly between the root inversion Am triad on the top three strings and the 1st inversion triad at the 5th fret, so play both of them.

2. Repeat for the next higher position on the neck.

    In Am this is box 1, and you'd play A on the 6th string to C on the 1st ascending, then descend back to the low A (finishing the sequence because the lowest note also happens to be the root in this position).

    Then you would play the 2nd inversion Am triad at the 5th fret of the top three strings.

    {{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/bs-box1.png" caption="Am blues scale, box 1" width="33%" >}}{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/box1-minor-chord.png" caption="Am box 1 minor chord" width="33%" >}}

3. Now *connect* the lower shape to the higher, shifting between positions on **string 1**.

    E.g. to connect Am box 5 to Am box 1, first ascend from the low G on string 6 to the high A on string 1. (It's not necessary to start/end on root notes in this step.)

    Next, shift your hand up three frets to box 1, and play the C on string 1.

    Then descend, play C then A on string 1, shift down to box 5, and continue descending to the low G on string 6.

    {{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/b5-b1-s1.png" caption="Am Box5 to Box1, string 1 shift" width="50%" >}}

4. Next connect the shapes by shifting between positions on **string 2**.

    E.g. Starting with Am box 5, you'd play from the low G on string 6 to the E on string 2. Then shift to box 1, and continue ascending: playing the notes G, A, and C in box 1.

    Now descend, playing C, A, G, and E in box 1. Then shift to box 5, and continue descending to the low G on string 6.

    {{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/b5-b1-s2.png" caption="Am Box5 to Box1, string 2 shift" width="50%" >}}

5. Repeat with the shift on **string 3**.

    {{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/b5-b1-s3.png" caption="Am Box5 to Box1, string 3 shift" width="50%" >}}

6. Again, but shifting on **string 4**.

    {{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/b5-b1-s4.png" caption="Am Box5 to Box1, string 4 shift" width="50%" >}}

7. Then shifting on **string 5**.

    {{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/b5-b1-s5.png" caption="Am Box5 to Box1, string 5 shift" width="50%" >}}

8. And finally shifting postions on **string 6**.

    {{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/b5-b1-s6.png" caption="A Box5 to Box1, string 6 shift" width="50%" >}}

After finishing the connection drill between, e.g., boxes 5 and 1 of the Am blues scale, repeat the entire sequence connecting between boxes 1 and 2.

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/bs-box2.png" caption="Am Box 2" width="33%" >}}{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/box2-minor-chord.png" caption="Am Box 2 minor chord" width="33%" >}}

Then between box 2 and box 3.

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/bs-box3.png" caption="Am Box 3" width="33%" >}}{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/box3-minor-chords.png" caption="Am box 3 minor chords" width="33%" >}}

Then between boxes 3 and 4.

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/bs-box3.png" caption="Am Box 3" width="33%" >}}{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/box4-minor-chord.png" caption="Am box 4 minor chord" width="33%" >}}

And finally between boxes 4 and 5.

That's five connection drills with six strings each, or thirty total position changes to practice **for just one key**.

Next, repeat the entire sequence for all seven minor keys with a natural root note (Bm, Em, Am, Dm, Gm, Cm, Fm).

Finally, repeat for all seven **Major** keys with a natural root (B, E, A, D, G, C, and F).

It's unlikely (!!) you'll be able (or at least willing) to complete all 420 patterns in a single practice session. It's much more reasonable to limit yourself to just one key (thirty patterns) per day over a course of two or more weeks.

Pass criteria for this exercise is to be able to perform the complete exercise rubato for any given key. Test yourself periodically in different random major and minor keys.
