I've started populating the [guitar](/guitar/) section of the site with some beginner content.
<!--more-->

First up is a rewrite of an old post on [basic theory to learn the notes on the fretboard]({{< ref "/guitar/2019-02-11-just-12-notes.md" >}}).

Next is [a post that puts that theory to practice]({{< ref "/guitar/2020-03-17-note-locations" >}}) and teaches you how to learn the notes on the fretboard.

Next up is a series of posts on [simple chord shapes]({{< ref "/guitar/2020-03-19-beginner-chords.md" >}}). I've only published the first of these so far, but by the time anyone reads this, I may have published a couple more on barre chords and minor chords.

I'm using "test driven guitar" with all of these. The (non theory) posts start with a TDG test, a way of verifying your progress. TDG is a way of identifying what you still need to work on (and to keep track of what you've mastered!).

Eventually I plan to add identity (logins) to the site with individual user metadata to track progress. Each user will maintain a state of "not started," "in progress," or "completed" for all of the TDG items. I'll then create some sort of dashboard to let you see at a glance what you should be working from, letting you pick an choose from any of the "in progress" or "not started" items that tickle your fancy.
