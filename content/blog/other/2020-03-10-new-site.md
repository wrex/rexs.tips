Time for a refresh.

I'm going to retire [the old site](https://lessons.doiwalters.com) and start using this site exclusively going forward. It should be faster, better on mobile, and it allows me to post on any topic (not just guitar). It's **way** easier to maintain versions, backups, branches, etc., and it's trivial for me to deploy new content. What's not to like?

If you're curious about the technical details, I've decided on the following:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as the static site Generator.
* [LoveIt](https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/) as the theme for the site.
* [Hover](https://www.hover.com) for my domain registration.
* [Github](https://github.io) for version control
* [Netlify](https://www.cloudflare.com) for deployment and CDN

As always, this is as much about tinkering as anything.

I'm particularly impressed with the [LoveIt](https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/) theme (talk about bells and whistles) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

It's trivial for me to publish new info: I just edit a markdown file, commit the changes with git, and push the changes to github. Shazam! The changes are published within a minute or two on the production site, and I have fully version controlled backups both on my local machine and in the cloud (on [Github](https://github.io)). Wonderful.

I could have even registered my domain with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), to begin with, instead of using [Hover](https://www.hover.com). [Hover](https://www.hover.com) is great, but one stop shopping is also nice.

Everything other than domain registration is absolutely free for the little traffic and data I have, too. Hooray!
