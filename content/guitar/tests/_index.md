## The rules

**Rule 1:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice what you want.

**Rule 2:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Track what you practice.

**Rule 3:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never work on more than 5 things at a time.

## How to practice

### Preparation

1. Create a dedicated practice area as distraction-free as possible. Just the
   corner of a room suffices, but everything you need should be out and ready to
   go. You'll need your guitar, a clock and calendar, a kitchen timer, and a
   metronome. Phone apps work for the timer and metronome, but dedicated
   hardware is better (switching between apps on your phone can be distracting).

2. Maintain a dedicated journal to track your practice. Bound pages are better
   than a three-ring binder.

3. Write down a list of one to five things that you want to practice for the
   next several days, weeks or months. This list is your `focus list`. **Print
   out your focus list and hang it prominently** near your practice area. Change
   one or more items on your `focus list` whenever you want, but never put more
   than 5 things on the list. Items can be anything you want to work on: drills
   from this site or any other.

4. Add an entry to your journal every time you attempt a proficiency test from
   this site. Be sure to note when you master a test as well (be sure to give
   yourself a treat when you do!). Eventually, I hope to provide automated
   tracking for logged in users, but don't hold your breath.

### At the start of each practice session

1. Write the date and time at the top of a fresh page in your journal.

2. If you don't already have entries from a previous session, write down the
   items you intend to work on. It's okay to change your mind.

### During each session

1. Write down which exercises/tests you work on, how much time you spent on
   each, and any notes or thoughts about that item.

2. Try not to cheat regarding time spent. Only write down the truly focused time
   you spent on the exercise (a kitchen timer will keep you honest).

### At the end of each session

1. Write down any final thoughts you might have (difficulty, questions, etc.).
   Did you work on all the items you intended?

2. Write your finish time at the top of the page.

3. On the next fresh page, write down the items you _intend_ to practice next
   time. You may feel like practicing something else when the time comes, but
   having something already written down may be just the nudge you need to get
   going.

The system is simple, but it has helped me tremendously. I no longer feel
overwhelmed by working on too many things at once.

## The rules in detail

### Rule 1. Practice what you want

At the risk of stating the obvious: if you hate to practice, then eventually you
_won't_ practice. Full stop.

Ideally, practice should be at least somewhat enjoyable, but keep the following in mind:

- There is no point in practicing what you've already mastered. Warm-up drills
  and some technique exercises are an exception.

- If what you're practicing is too hard, you'll hate practicing. If something is
  too difficult, break it into smaller chunks and practice those in turn,
  building up to the full exercise. Baby steps, baby, baby steps.

- Try to balance the five T's: theory, technique, tones (ear training), tunes,
  and timing. Not every session, but over the long haul.

- Remember that _you play what you practice._ The way you practice scales,
  triads, etc. will show up in your playing eventually. If you only practice
  scales by mechanically going up and down the scale linearly with a constant
  rhythm, guess how your solos will sound to listeners? Try to be musical with
  your practice! (This is why almost all the proficiency tests proceed in
  fourths, by the way.)

### Rule 2. Track what you practice

The simple act of writing down what you're working on helps you focus.
Maintain a journal!

Track how much _time_ you spend practicing:

- Mark off every single day you practice on a wall-mounted calendar, even if you
  only practice for five minutes. Seeing long, unbroken strings on a calendar
  can be a real motivator.

- **Use a kitchen timer** for practice sessions. Don't just look at a
  clock occasionally! Five minutes of focused effort as measured by a timer is
  **far** more valuable than half an hour of farting around and looking at the
  clock occasionally.

- **Use a metronome**. Almost all the proficiency tests require a metronome to
  demonstrate you've mastery, but a metronome helps even when you
  are still building proficiency. Remember that you can use whole
  notes, half notes, quarter notes, triplets, and sixteenth notes in addition to
  adjusting the BPM!

- **Record yourself**. Objectively listening to yourself is a million times
  easier if you _aren't currently focused on playing_. Get in the habit of
  recording yourself often. Go back and listen to old recordings periodically,
  too.

### Rule 3. Never work on more than five things at a time.

Three things at a time is even better (but hard to stick to).

Your `focus list` should change slowly, certainly no more than every several
days. If you're tired of working on something, feel free to swap it out for
anything else that interests you, but **nothing feels better than taking
something off the list because you've mastered it**. Persistence is a virtue.

## A web app to manage your practice sessions

I'm creating a web app to assist with practice. When finished, it will:

- Track changes to your focus list
- Tell you which practice items you've practiced and when
- Tell you which items you've mastered
- Provide a basic timer and (hopefully) metronome

I've decided against letting one take notes in the app, as I think it's better
to maintain a written journal.

I'm designing the app "mobile-first" but expect it to be equally usable on a
small or large screen.

I'm designing the app from scratch. I'm writing it in React.js (with Gatsby, to
be more specific). It's looking like it will take me a few months to complete.
Hopefully, I'll have something out by the end of the summer.

Note that the app will **not** replace the manual process described above, it
will simply make the process a little easier.
