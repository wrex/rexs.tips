**Rule 1:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice what you want.

**Rule 2:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Track what you practice.

**Rule 3:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never work on more than 5 things at a time.

## How to practice

### Preparation

1. Create a dedicated practice area as distraction free as possible. Just the corner of a room is fine, but everything you need should be out and ready to go. You'll need your guitar, a clock and calendar, a kitchen timer, and a metronome. Phone apps are fine for the timer and metronome, but dedicated hardware is better.

2. Maintain a dedicated journal to track your practice. Something with bound pages is probably better than a three ring binder.

3. Write down a list of one to five things that you want to practice for the next several days, weeks or months. This is your `focus list`. **Print out your focus list and hang it prominently** near your practice area. You can change out an item and make a new `focus list` whenever you want, but you can never have more than 5 items on the list. Items on the list can be proficiency tests from this site or anything else you find you want to work on.

4. Keep track of any proficency tests from this site that you attempt. Add an entry to your journal every time you attempt a proficiency test, as well as when you master it (be sure to give yourself a treat when you do!). Eventually I hope to provide automated tracking for logged in users, but don't hold your breath.

### At the start of each practice session

1. Write the date and time at the top of a fresh page in your journal.

2. If you don't already have entries from a previous session, write down the items you intend to work on. It's okay to change your mind from the previous session.

### During each session

1. Write down which exercises/tests you work on, how much time you spent on each, and any notes or thoughts about that item.

2. Try not to cheat regarding time spent. Document only the truly focused time you spent on the exercise (a kitchen timer will keep you honest).

### At the end of each session

1. Write down any final thoughts you might have (difficulty, questions, etc.). Did you work on all the items you intended?

2. Write your finish time at the top of the page.

3. On the next fresh page, write down the items you *intend* to practice next time. Ideally, next time you'll just need to write


The system is simple, but it works. It's really helped me from becoming overwhelmed from working on too many things at once.

## The rules

### Rule 1. Practice what you want

Seems obvious, but if you hate to practice, then eventually you *won't* practice. Full stop.

Ideally, practice should be at least somewhat enjoyable, but keep the following in mind:

* There is no point in practicing what you've already mastered. Warm-up drills and some technique exercises are an exception.

* If what you're practicing is too hard, you'll hate practicing. If something is too difficult, break it into smaller chunks and practice those in turn, building up to the full exercise. Baby steps, baby, baby steps.

* Try to balance the five T's: theory, technique, tones (ear training), tunes, and timing. Not every session, but over the long haul.

* Remember that *you play what you practice.* The way you practice scales, triads, etc. will show up in your playing eventually. If you only practice scales by mechanically going up and down the scale linearly with a constant rhythm, guess how your solos will sound to listeners? Try to be musical with your practice! (This is why almost all the proficiency tests proceed in fourths, by the way.)

### Rule 2. Track what you practice

The simple act of writing down what you're working on can really help you focus. Maintain a journal!

Track how much *time* you spend practicing:

* Mark off every single day you practice on a wall-mounted calendar, even if you only practice for five minutes. Seeing long, unbroken strings on a calendar can be a real motivator.

* **Use a kitchen timer** for focused practice sessions. Don't just look at a clock occasionally! Five minutes of focused effort as measured by a timer is **far** more valuable than a half hour of farting around and looking at the clock occasionally.

* **Use a metronome**. Almost all the proficiency tests require a metronome to demonstrate you've mastered an exercise, but a metronome helps even when you are still building your skill with an exercise. Remember you can use whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, triplets, and sixteenth notes in addition to adjusting the BPM!

### Rule 3. Never work on more than five things at a time.

Three things at a time is even better (but hard to stick to).

Your `focus list` should change slowly, certainly no more than every several days. If you're tired of working on something, feel free to swap it out for anything else that interests you, but **nothing feels better than taking something off the list because you've mastered it**. Persistence is a virtue.
