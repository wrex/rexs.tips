**Rule 1.** Practice what you want, but remember you'll tend to *play* what you practice.

**Rule 2.** Track what you practice.

**Rule 3.** Never work on more than 5 things at a time.

## How to practice

### Preparation

1. Create a dedicated practice area as distraction free as possible. Just the corner of a room is fine, but everything you need should be out and ready to go. You'll need your guitar, a clock and calendar, a kitchen timer, and a metronome. Phone apps are fine for the timer and metronome, but dedicated hardware is better.

2. Maintain a dedicated journal to track your practice. Something with bound in pages is probably better than a three ring binder.

3. Write down a list of one to five things that you want to practice for the next several days, weeks or months. This is your `focus list`. **Print out your focus list and hang it prominently** near your practice area. You can change out an item and make a new `focus list` whenever you want, but you can never have more than 5 items on the list. Items on the list can be proficiency tests from this site or anything else you find you want to work on.

4. Keep track of any proficency tests from this site that you attempt. Add an entry to your journal every time you attempt a proficiency test, as well as when you master it (be sure to give yourself a treat when you do!). Eventually I hope to provide automated tracking for logged in users, but don't hold your breath.

### At the start of each practice session

1. Write the date and time at the top of a fresh page in your journal.

2. If you don't already have entries from a previous session, write down the items you intend to work on. It's okay to change your mind from the previous session.

### During each session

1. Write down which exercises/tests you work on, how much time you spent on each, and any notes or thoughts about that item.

2. Try not to cheat regarding time spent. Document only the truly focused time you spent on the exercise (a kitchen timer will keep you honest).

### At the end of each session

1. Write down any final thoughts you might have (difficulty, questions, etc.). Did you work on all the items you intended?

2. Write your finish time at the top of the page.

3. On the next fresh page, write down the items you *intend* to practice next time. Ideally, next time you'll just need to write


The system is simple, but it works. It's really helped me from becoming overwhelmed from working on too many things at once.
