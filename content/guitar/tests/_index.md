**Rule 1.** Practice what you want.

**Rule 2.** Track what you practice.

**Rule 3.** Never work on more than 5 things at a time.

Here's how:

### Preparation

1. Create a dedicated practice area as distraction free as possible. Just the corner of a room is fine, but everything you need should be out and ready to go. You'll need your guitar, a clock and calendar, a kitchen timer, and a metronome. Phone apps are fine for the timer and metronome, but dedicated hardware is better.

2. Maintain a dedicated journal to track your practice. Something with bound in pages is probably better than a three ring binder.

3. Maintain a list of one to five proficiency tests from this site that you want to work on. This is your `focus list`. Use the [focus list picker](#TODO) to print out your `focus list`. **Print out your focus list and hang it prominently** near your practice area.

4. Maintain an updated list of *all* the proficency tests on this site. Print this out and keep it near your practice journal.

### At the start of each practice session

1. Write the date and time at the top of a fresh page.

2. If you don't already have entries from a previous session, write down the items you intend to work on.

### During each session

1. Write down which tests you work on, how much time you spent each, and any notes or thoughts about that item.

2. Try not to cheat regarding time spent. Document only the truly focused time you spent on the exercise (a kitchen timer keeps you honest).

### At the end of each session

1. Write down any final thoughts you might have (difficulty, questions, etc.). Did you work on all the items you intended?

2. Write your finish time at the top of the page.

3. On the next fresh page, write down the items you *intend* to practice next time. Ideally, next time you'll just need to write


That's it!
