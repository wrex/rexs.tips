## Procedure

Either record your own strumming or use an app like
[iRealPro](https://irealpro.com) to create a _simple_ backing track with just
two chords. Use a nice, slow, simple 4/4 tempo.

1. Two bars of Am7
2. Two bars of Dm7

A simple one-strum-per-beat recording suffices, but you can use any rhythm or
style you like. If you know more than one voicing for either chord, use any or all of
them. Different voicings are fine, but only record *one* chord in each bar.

There is no need to make the backing track too exciting, but it's good to make
it at least somewhate musical. Remember you play what you practice.

### Am pentatonic over both chords

Use the [connected pan shapes]({{< ref
"guitar/blues/min-penta/more-pans#more-pans" >}}) shapes to solo over this
backing track with the Am pentatonic scale:

1. Play the root note of the underlying chord on the downbeat of 1 in each
   measure. Play the note A over Am, and D over Dm.

  * First just play just the root by itself, with different rhythms and
    dynamics, but be sure to hit the right root on the downbeat of 1. Be sure to
    anticipate the changes!
  * Next, play each of the other notes in the frying pan, coming back to the
    root each time, again hitting the root on each change. 
  * Try different rhythms and articulation. Really listen to how the root
    sounds, and how it *feels* like home each time you come back to it.
  * Try *bending* from the &flat;7 to the root (or *releasing* from a pre-bent root down to
    the &flat;7) instead of just fretting the notes.

2. Next, continue returning to the appropriate root periodically, but start emphasizing each of the
   other notes in turn a bit more.

  * Stay on them longer.
  * Play with dynamics: softer/louder/slapped/plucked/muted.
  * Try a bit of vibrato.
  * Play with articulations: hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides and bends bends from other notes in the the frying pan shape.
  * Try articulations from a fret below or a fret above.
  * Start playing with multi-note *phrases*. Develop your own licks.

After a while it should become obvious that the root note always sounds "best"
(or at least "most resolved").

The movement from a i chord to a iv chord (or back from the iv to the i) is
**extremely** common. Listen to how each of the five notes sounds over each
chord.

Notice how the note D sounds a bit out of place over Am. That's because 
Am7 comprses the notes A, C, E, G --- with no D present. 

As soon as Dm comes around, though, that D note sounds particularly sweet.
Playing D right as the chords change _emphasizes the change_. Nothing sounds
more professional than playing solo notes that outline chord changes!

Pay attention to how the _function_ of each note changes. In particular, note
how the &flat;3 of the i chord (C) becomes the &flat;7 of the iv chord. One of
the best ways to sound like you know what you're doing is to emphasize thirds
and sevenths in your playing. How does it sound to bend C up to D right as the
backing track moves to Dm?

Remember to use different slurs and articulations. In particular, be sure to try
curling the C when you're over Am to add a little tension.

### Different scales over each chord

You've seen how just the five notes A, C, D, E, and G suffice to make coherent
lines over a i-iv progression. Many people have made entire careers using just a
single scale to solo over entire songs. 

That's not the only way to play, however.

Most "roots music" songs have just a single "key". Some music styles like jazz
have more complicated harmonies and key changes, but for the most part you can
think about one key for an entire song. 

That's why it's okay to play the Am pentatonic scale over both Am and Dm: both
chords are in the key of Am.

There are at least three strategies to think about soloing over the iv chord
(Dm), however: 

* You can continue playing Am pentatonic, emphasizing D, A, and C. (This is the
  strategy we used above.)

* You can think "key of the moment" and play Dm pentatonic instead (the notes D,
  F, G, A, and C). You play Dm pentatonic by moving the frying pan shape onto a
  higher string set, or by moving the shape five frets up the neck.

* You can continue using Am pentatonic, but think about _adding_ the note F. You
  add the note F to the frying pan by extending the "handle" one more fret.
  You'll probably want to play F rather than E when playing over Dm.

The first strategy is sometimes called "playing _over_ the changes."

The second and third strategies are called "playing the changes."

Repeat the exercises above, playing the changes:

1. Repeat the exercise using Am pentatonic over Am, and Dm pentatonic over Dm.

2. Repeat the exercise by staying on Am pentatonic, but "extending the handle"
   over Dm by playing F. (Note that F can be found in other locations, too!)


Notice that these two scales are _very_ closely related. 

## Pass criteria

You can never really "master" this exercise. Try to stick with it for at least
an hour or more, but come back to it periodically as you gain more experience.

## Extra credit

Note that Am pentatonic and Dm pentatonic are _very_ closely related. They share
the four notes A, C, D, and G:

```
Am pentatonic: A  C  D  E  G
               R  b3 4  5  b7

Dm pentatonic: A  C  D  F  G
               5  b7 R  b3 4
```

E and F are interesting because they are only a semitone apart. Explore this in
your solos to outline the changes. Try ending a phrase on E over the least beat
of Am, then slide or bend it up to F just as the chord changes to Dm.

Now reverse it. End a phrase on F over Dm, then bring it down to E just as the
chord moves back to Am.

Amazing how much difference a semitone can make, isn't it?
