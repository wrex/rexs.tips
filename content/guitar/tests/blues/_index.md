## Procedure

1. Spend the rest of your life listening to, playing, and living the Blues.

Okay, I'm joking. There's no way to create a single master test for such a large

Here, however, are a few **basic** blues fundamentals I think anyone should
master before they can even begin mastering the form:

1. {{< tdgref "blues/basics/simple-dom7" >}}
2. {{< tdgref "blues/pan-connection-drills" >}}
3. {{< tdgref "blues/minor-penta/min-blues" >}}
4. {{< tdgref "blues/minor-penta/maj-blues" >}}
