## Demonstration

{{< youtube 1CW3CWGVQdA  >}}

## Procedure

This one is also a "time in saddle" exercise. Try to find some quiet time alone for this one.

Find or create three drum loops. You can use a DAW like [Garage Band](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/), [iRealPro](https://irealpro.com) or simply [search on YouTube](https://www.google.com/search?as_q=drum+loop&as_sitesearch=youtube.com) (I'm particularly fond of [daniB5000's collection of loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthENQ0TV8A&list=PLOJ1IeFyn1eirhy97EF7FB7F3kBnWg3yl&index=29)).

Any style, any rhythm, and any tempo is fine. Try to pick three completely different loops, though, rather than three in the same vein. Just find three loops that get you tapping your foot and moving your body.

Spend 20 minutes with each loop. **Use a kitchen timer!** This one is *fun* so you may find the twenty minutes go by *faster* than you expect.

For each loop:

First just **listen** for several bars. Find the bar: count along and figure out where the rhythm repeats. Is it in 4/4? 3/4? 6/8? If you can't figure out how to count along with each measure, make a note in your journal so you can come back to it another day, and find a simpler loop.

Next, identify the different rhythms produced by each element in the kit. Focus on the high-hat or ride cymbal for a while. Then listen for the snare. Then focus on just the kick. You'll probably find that the drummer is somehow emphasizing the 2 and 4 (usually with the snare). Is it a straight feel? Triplets? Swung eighths?

Move your body with the groove, and be sure to count along in your head.

First you will just make scratch rhythms with all six strings muted. Lay your left hand across all the strings and don't fret any notes.

1. **Mimic** what the drummer is doing with each element individually. First just hit or snap the low strings in time with the kick. Then aim for the higher strings and perhaps mimic the sound of the snare. Then maybe the cymbals. Try muting the strings higher and lower on the neck to create lower and higher pitched scratches. Bang on the body. Change the angle of your pick. Pick harder and lighter, slowly or snapped. Anything you can think of to create interesting sounds that mimic different parts of the drum kit.

2. Next, start *combining* some of these sounds. "Play" different combinations kick, snare, and high-hat within each measure.

3. Now experiment with fretted chords for some of the beats (but still plenty of scratches). Stick to just one chord, but you can play that chord anywhere and everywhere you know how. Play in time with the drum, but you no longer need to mimic exactly what the drummer is doing. Be sure to mix up what you do on the low strings and on the high ones.

4. Finally, start *adding complexity* to the rhythm. If the drummer is just playing a single snare hit on 2 and 4, try playing quick sixteenth note triplets on the same beats. If the cymbals are a constant eighth note ride, try playing sixteenth note triads way up high on the neck. Experiment. Make *music*!

**Record yourself** as you practice this exercise.

## Pass criteria

You are the judge for this one. Listen to the recording you made of yourself. Does it sound musical? Did you play in time? Were you rushing or playing behind the beat? Did it sound like you were playing with *intent*?
