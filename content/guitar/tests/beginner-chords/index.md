This is proficiency test **{{% param tdgid %}}**

## Demonstration

{{< youtube yGAtYO0VMsA  >}}

## Procedure

Set a metronome to 60 BPM.

This test uses the open position major chords (the "cowboy chords"):

{{< figproc "cowboy-chords" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}
Use a simple two beat rhythm for each chord, e.g. one beat letting the notes ring, followed by a short muted strum on the second beat.

Starting with B7, play through each chord in the order above. Focus on clean sounding chords and an even rhythm.

Now repeat the progression backwards (in fifths rather than fourths), starting with F.

Finally, repeat the chords in alphabetic order (it won't sound very musical): A, B7, C, D, E, F, G.

## Pass criteria

Pass criteria: You can play all three chord progressions (fourths, fifths, alphabetic) cleanly and in time at 60 BPM with chord changes every whole note.
