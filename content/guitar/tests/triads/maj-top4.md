## Procedure

As always, this test proceeds in fourths, starting with the note B and proceeding through all seven natural notes (sharps and flats are optional).

For each note, perform the exercise once on the GBE strings, and then again on the DGB string set.

The test should be performed with quarter notes at 60BPM.

1. On the GBE string set:

  * Find the current note on the current string set as low on the neck as possible. Form the appropriate major triad shape for a root note on that string.

  * Play that major triad on the beat.

  * Move to the next note in the cycle nearby and play the appropriate triad for that root note. You should only need to move your hand one or two frets higher up the neck.

  * Continue up the neck until you've played all seven natural notes.

2. Repeat all seven notes on the DGB string set.


## Pass criteria

You can perform the exercise with quarter notes at 60 BPM without any mistakes.

## Extra credit

Perform the exercise with all 12 notes of the chromatic scale in fourths.
