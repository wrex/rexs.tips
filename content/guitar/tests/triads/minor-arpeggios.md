This test helps you to

1. Visualize minor arpeggios everywhere on the fretboard.

2. Program your fingers to play the full arpeggio, three-string triad arpeggios, and three-string chords (triads).

Because it descends from high strings to low, it emphasizes the top four strings.

## Demonstration

## Procedure

As usual, we will proceed through the natural notes in fourths.

Natural notes in fourths: B E A D G C F.

This test is played with *quarter notes* at 60BPM.

Play descending arps in groups of three strings:

1. For the current note, find the lowest complete arpeggio you can play on the neck (open strings included). For B, this will be the [A shape arpeggio]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/harmony/triads/minor#c-minor-arpeggios" >}}) starting at the second fret of the first string.

2. For each string set in the arpeggio, play the highest note, the middle note, then the base note. After arpeggiating all three notes, play them together as a chord.

3. Next, move to the next lower string set and repeat.

4. Continue until you reach the low E string, then shift to the next arpeggio shape starting at the same fret on the high E string.

5. Continue until you've played all three arpeggio shapes. (Optional: continue playing as high up the neck as you can reach.)

{{< alert color="info" title="Example" >}}
For B minor (B/D/F&sharp;):

1. You'd first play the F&sharp; at the second fret of the high E string, then D on the B string, then B on the G string.

2. Then you'd move to the DGB string set and play D, B, F&sharp;.

3. Then B, F&sharp;, D on ADG.

4. And finally, F&sharp;, B, and D on EAD.

## Pass criteria

You can play all three arpeggio shapes for all seven natural notes in time and without mistakes.

## Extra credit

Repeat the exercise, but *ascending*. Start with the *highest* shape you can reach on the neck, and play each arpeggio shape from the low E string to the high E string.

Don't attempt this until you are proficient with the regular test. It's more important to emphasize the higher strings.
