This is proficiency test **{{% param tdgid %}}**

## Procedure

Do not attempt this exercise until you are [proficient at naming the notes]({{< ref "guitar/tests/learn-neck" >}}) on the G, B, and E strings.

As always, you should practice this *rubato* (without a metronome) until you build up proficiency.

1. Set a metronome to 60 BPM. We will be playing half notes (two clicks per note).

2. Progress through every natural note in fourths.

  1. Find the note as low on the neck as possible on the first three strings.
  2. Form and strum the correct major triad inversion around that root note.
  3. Find the next location for that note higher up the neck (but still on the top three strings) and repeat with the next inversion.
  4. Again, move up the neck and play the final inversion.

Natural notes in fourths: B E A D G C F.

First you will strum all the B triads, then all the E triads, etc.

## Pass criteria

You can play all 36 triads in time and without mistakes.

## Extra credit

Play around with individual notes from the triad as well as strummed chords during the drill.
