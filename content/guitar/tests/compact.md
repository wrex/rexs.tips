You may wish to print out this page. (Note that tests may be added periodically.)

Whenever you start one of the items, put a dot in the box in the left column for that item, and mark the date in your journal.

Whenever you master an item, overwrite the dot with a check mark or an "X", update your journal, and celebrate.
