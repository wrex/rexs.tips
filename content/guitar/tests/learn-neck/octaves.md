## Procedure

As usual, our proficiency pace is half notes at 60 BPM. As always, try it without a metronome first.

Instead of the cycle of fourths, we'll just use the open string notes: EADGBe. The test is to use octave shapes to move both up and down the fretboard to find notes.

Starting with the open E on the sixth string. Say "E" out loud as you pluck the open string. Next use octave shape 1 to move up the fretboard. Play and say "E" at the 2nd fret of the D string. Then use shape 1a to move up another octave to the 5th fret of the 2nd string.

We can't continue onto thinner strings because we are out of strings, so use shape 2a to find the E on the 5th string at the 7th fret. (Technically, this E is in a lower octave even though you are moving up the fretboard.)

We can't continue onto thicker strings, so back to shape 1 and play the E at the 9th fret of the 3rd string.

Finally, shape 1a onto the 12th fret of the high E string.

We've now played an E on all six strings.

[As an aside: we played E in three different octaves. Every time we used shape 1 or 1a we moved up an octave, but when we used shape 2 we went back *down* an octave.]

Now we are going to start with the A at the 12th fret. Play and say "A" there, then use shape 2 to find the A on the 2nd string at the 10th fret. Continue the zigzag patter back down the fretboard until you reach the open A on the 5th string.

Repeat the exercise for the remaining open string (or 12th fret) notes: G, B, and the high E string.

## Pass criteria

You can use octave shapes to play every open string note everywhere on the fretboard at 60 BPM with half notes.
