This is proficiency test **{{% param tdgid %}}**

### Procedure

1. Set a metronome to 60 BPM. We will be playing half notes (two clicks per note).

2. Progress through every natural note in fourths, finding and playing each note **on the A string**.

{{< alert color="info" >}}
Natural notes in fourths: B E A D G C F.
{{< /alert >}}

First you will find the note B, then the note E, and so on, finishing with the note F.

It's okay to play *rubato* (out of time, without a metronome) for your first several attempts at this exercise, but start using a metronome as soon as possible, starting with whole notes (four clicks per note) then moving to half notes and perhaps even quarter notes (a new note every click).

### Pass criteria

Successfully work through all seven natural notes while keeping time and without any flubs or misses. It's okay to pause up to a full bar before moving onto the next note, but you must play each note on all six strings in half note time without missing a beat (both ascending and descending).

### Extra credit (but recommended)

Complete the exercise with all 12 notes in the cycle of fourths, not just the natural notes.

{{< alert color="info" >}}
All twelve notes in fourths: B E A D G C F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; D&flat; G&flat;. The cycle then continues back to B.
{{< /alert >}}

### Extra credit #2

Repeat the exercise with quarter notes rather than half notes. If you can accomplish this you definitely **KNOW** the A string!
