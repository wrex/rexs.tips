## Demonstration

This is the "graduation test" for **KNOWING** the notes on the neck. Please work on the indivual sub-tests listed below to gain proficiency before attempting this test.

## Procedure

1. Set a metronome to 60 BPM. We will be playing half notes (two clicks per note).

2. Progress through every natural note in fourths, finding and playing each note on the first 12 frets.

    * First ascend from the low E string up to each thinner string. Play the note on each string in turn.
    * Then *descend* down the strings, finding the same note on each string again.

Natural notes in fourths: B E A D G C F.
{{< /alert >}}

First you will find the note B on every string, then the note E, and so on, finishing with the note F.

For each note, be sure to first play ascending from the lowest string to the highest string, playing the note on each string in turn. **Then return descending** playing first on the thinnest string and progressing to the thickest. For some strange reason, going in both directions seems to assist with memorization.

## Pass criteria

Successfully work through all seven natural notes while keeping time and without any flubs or misses. It's okay to pause up to a full bar before moving onto the next note, but you must play each note on all six strings in half note time without missing a beat (both ascending and descending).

## Extra credit (but recommended)

Complete the exercise with all 12 notes in the cycle of fourths, not just the natural notes.

{{< alert color="info" >}}
All twelve notes in fourths: B E A D G C F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; D&flat; G&flat;. The cycle then continues back to B.
{{< /alert >}}

## Extra credit #2

Repeat the exercise with quarter notes rather than half notes. If you can accomplish this you definitely **KNOW** your fretboard!
