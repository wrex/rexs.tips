This is proficiency test **{{% param tdgid %}}**

## Procedure

This one is really simple.

Just practice saying the full 12 note cycle of fourths *out loud* a few times: B E A D G C F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; D&flat; G&flat;. Keep looping around from G&flat; to B and continue the cycle.

Once you are bored with that practice starting on different notes within the sequence and continuing around the "clock" (without looking at the image above of course!). Starting at F, for example, say *out loud* "F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; ...."

## Pass criteria

1. You can answer questions like the following *effortlessly*:
    * What's a fourth above D?
    * What's a fourth above A&flat;?

2. You can start on any of the 12 notes and effortlessly recite the entire cycle of fourths starting on that note.
