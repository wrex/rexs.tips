To play guitar well, to play with *intent* rather than just memorizing patterns, you **must be able to find notes anywhere on the fretboard** instantly and effortlessly (get used to seeing those two words a lot on this site).

The goal is to "hear" any given sound in your head and intuitively know how to reproduce it on your instrument, without conscious effort. This takes years of practice, but it starts by learning where different notes are on the fretboard.

This really should be one of the very first thing you learn on the guitar (along with some simple chord shapes and strumming patterns), but it is a surprisingly steep first step. It's *harder* on stringed instruments like the guitar because *the same note can be found in multiple locations along the neck*.

Before you can learn how to play the notes, though, you need to learn their names and how they work.

The first thing to realize is that **there are only twelve unique notes in all of of western music**. Not just hillbilly, but classical music, rock, and jazz, too.

## Shapes versus notes

A surprising number of guitarists never learn where all the notes are on the fretboard, much less how to read music. This is a real shame. Musicians learning almost any other instrument **start** by associating written notes on the staff with where and how to produce those notes on their instrument. It’s an odd quirk and unfortunate side-effect of a guitar’s layout that encourages students to think abut "shaps" rather than notes.

For example, the first thing millions of beginners learn is how to play this C Major chord:

<a id="fig1"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/cmajor-open.png" title="Fig 1. C Major, Open Position" class="figure-caption text-center" >}}

They learn how to form this **shape** on the fretboard. They then associate this shape in their heads with "C Major", along with different shapes for, say, "D Major" and "G major". They think of this (often for *years*) as the *only* way to play a C Major chord.

But **shapes aren't music**.

That diagram only shows *one* way to play a C Major.

As we will learn when we start studying chords and harmony, C Major is formed when you play the three notes C, E, and G simultaneously. [Figure 1](#fig1) is just one way to play those notes. From left to right (starting on the 5th string) the shape above sounds the *notes* C, E, G, C (again), and E (again). It's because those three notes are the only ones sounding that make this a C chord, not the shape.

Seriously, even small children learning piano can soon play a C major chord several different ways all over the keyboard. Literally millions of guitarists, though, never learn any way other than the diagram above, which is sad.

Shapes aren't all bad. You can't learn guitar without memorizing shapes.

Shapes make it much, much easier for guitarists to play in different keys. This is far more difficult on other instruments. A guitarist is *much* more likely to play in a horn player's natural key (like F or Bb) than for a horn player to play in E, A, D or G (convenient keys for the guitar).

While shapes can be a useful device to help you memorize and find notes/scales/chords, it's important not to think of them as an end in themselves.

## The musical alphabet

What follows is an over-simplified, highly condensed, and likely wrong history, but the concepts may prove helpful as we proceed.

I've already mentioned that all western music is comprised of twelve notes.

Seven of them are named after the first seven letters of the alphabet, A through G. Those are called the *natural notes*.

The remaining five are called *accidentals*, and get different names, like E&flat; or G&sharp; (pronounced "E flat" and "G sharp"). Not every note can take a sharp or flat, though. There is no such thing as "C&flat;" or "E&sharp;."

I can already here the first chorus of "why"s so I'll attempt to answer the following common questions up front, with further discussion below:

Why are there 12 notes, but only 7 get a letter?
: Because the most important scales in Western music, especially the Major Scale, have seven notes, with each note separated from the other by two different intervals (a whole step, or a half step). Following the same sequence of intervals, but starting on different notes leads to "in between" notes.


Why do some notes have two names (like Eb/D#)?
: Mostly because we want each of the seven notes in a "diatonic" key to be labled A-G. The key of F, for example, comprises the seven notes F, G, A, B&flat;, C, D, and E. It would be weird to call the note A&sharp; instead of B&flat; when playing a song in that key, as you'd have two "A" notes (the scale would become F, G, A, A&sharp;, C, D, and E).

Also, sometimes you want to alter a chord for different textures. "The Hendrix chord," for example, sharpens the 9th scale degree in the chord so it's common to use &sharp; if the 9th scale degree lands on an accidental.

Why isn't there a note called Cb or E#?
: See [diatonic scales](#diatonic-scales) below. No matter which note you start on, you never need a note between B/C or between E/F.

What does diatonic mean?
: See below.

Why did my piano teacher start the major scale (the white keys) at C and not A?
: The over-simplied answer is that early music was mostly minor. The notes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G can either be considered the A minor scale or the C Major scale.


## Diatonic scales

In the earliest days of western music (think Gregorian chants) there were just seven notes. They were eventually named A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, but they could have been named John, Paul, George, Ringo, Larry, Moe, and Curly. They were just *names*.

Each note had its own pitch or tone, and each note in the sequence had a pitch that was higher than the prior one. The note B had a slightly higher pitch than A, and G was almost, but not quite, double the pitch of A.

Today, if you *exactly* double (or halve) the pitch of any given note, the resultant tone still keeps the same name. The tone produced at 440 Hz is called "A" but so are the tones at 880 Hz, 220 Hz, and 1760 Hz. They are all just the note "A". (Read up on [equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament) if you're curious about why this wasn't always true.)

It's important to realize that the pitches between each of the seven notes were **not** equally spaced. The spacing was originally based on integer ratios like 3:2 and 5:4 that were pleasing to the ear. The resulting tones were roughly the same as those produced by the white keys on a piano today, including a smaller interval between B and C, and between E and F than between any of the other notes.

The seven notes thus produced successively higher pitches, and repeated indefinitely: `A B C D E F G A B C D E F G A...`. This is why each sequence of seven notes is called an *octave*, by the way &mdash; the sequence repeats every eighth note.

This uneven spacing of seven notes eventually became known as a *diatonic* scale. It was called "diatonic" (literally "two tones") because the distance between any two consecutive notes was either a whole step (a *tone*) or a half step (a *semitone*).

Today, a *tone* is exactly equivalent to two *semitones*, and **playing one fret higher on the guitar neck produces a note exactly one *semitone* higher**. Two frets higher and you produce a note a whole *tone* higher.

## Triads

Because of this uneven spacing, the sound/feeling of note groupings *changes* as you play different groups of notes. This is particularly true when playing notes at the same time (harmony) but is also true with melodies (individual notes played sequentially in time).

The most important note groupings are called *triads*, three note groupings.

Technically, a *triad* is any three note grouping, but the most interesting triads are the ones formed by playing every other note: `A/C/E`, `B/D/F`, `C/E/G`, etc.

Every triad sounds different, of course, because they contain different pitches, but some triads have similar *character* or *quality*. Musicians struggle to describe the *quality* of sounds, and often use moods, flavors, or colors as proxies.

Playing every other note starting from A (the notes A, C, and E) sounds vaguely sad wistful, or salty, for example. But playing every other note starting on C (C, E, G) sounds somewhat happy, resolved, or sweet. `A/C/E` has a similar quality to `D/F/A`, both are quite different from the *quality* of `C/E/G`.

As we stated earlier, the whole-step / half-step interval between each of the notes was *fixed*. There is a whole step between every pair of notes except between B and C and between E and F.

If we start with C, there is a whole step to D, another whole step to E, a half step to F, whole steps from G to B, then another half step to begin another sequence starting with a higher C. We call the characteristic sound or feel of this ordering of tone intervals (`W W h W W W h`) ***the major scale***. It sounds a vaguely happy.

Literally all of western music derives from the major scale. It should have been promoted to General by now.

## Modes

If we start on A rather than C, though, the intervals become: `W h W W h W W`. We call the character or *feel* of this sequence of intervals *minor* or *Aeolian mode*. It sounds vaguely sad to most people.

We call these different sequences of whole-tone and half-tone intervals *modes*. The first mode (the Major scale) obtained by starting on C is called *Ionian mode*.

If you start with G, you get *Mixolydian mode* (a great mode for soloing over the blues today, but I'm doubtful that any Gregorian blues chants survive).

The uneven spacing results in seven different "modes" for precisely **the same collection of seven notes**. It turns out that just by changing which note you consider the first (the "key") you can make music with very different "feels" even though you're using exactly the same notes.

Eventually, somebody thought: "But what if I want to produce (say) that sweet, happy Major/Ionian sound, but starting on the note G instead of C?"

In other words, they wanted a group of seven notes that starts on G, but followed the `W W h W W W h` interval sequence of Ionian mode. That would require the notes: G, a whole-step to A, whole step to B, half step to C, whole step to D, whole step to E, but then we need a whole step to ... what? F is too close (only a half step from E) and G is too far.

They needed a note halfway *between* F and G for it to sound Ionian instead of Mixolydian. Since this tone replaces F in the sequence, but wasn't F, they called it F&sharp;. It's just another name, but for a new note that wasn't used before.

It turns out that if you go through the process of creating every mode starting on each of the seven original notes, you'll end up needing five total of these "halfway" notes (one between A/B, C/D, D/E, F/G, and G/A).

These "in between" notes have *two* possible names, which can be confusing. The rule is simple, though, just use the name based on what you're replacing. In the example above, for G Ionian we replaced F so we called it F&sharp; and not G&flat;.

Including the seven original *natural* notes, you end up with twelve uniquely named notes:

## The twelve note names

1. A
2. A&sharp; or B&flat;
3. B
4. C
5. C&sharp; or D&flat;
6. D
7. D&sharp; or E&flat;
8. E
9. F
10. F&sharp; or G&flat;
11. G
12. G&sharp; or A&flat;


Remember that these are *just names* and an accident of history. They could have been named after the twelve apostles or the first twelve letters of the Greek alphabet, for example.

In some ways, it would have been nice if they had: things get confusing when we start talking about how the notes [function](#note-function) in different contexts.

Here are the notes to create a major (Ionian) scale starting on each of the original seven notes:

## The Major scale notes

* C Ionian: C D E F G A B (no sharps or flats)

* G Ionian: G A B C D E F&sharp; (one sharp)

* D Ionian: D E F&sharp; G A B C&sharp; (two sharps)

* A Ionian: A B C&sharp; D E F&sharp; G# (three sharps)

* E Ionian: E F&sharp; G&sharp; A B C&sharp; D&sharp; (four sharps)

* B Ionian: B C&sharp; D&sharp; E F&sharp; G&sharp; A&sharp; (five sharps)

Following the `W W h W W W h` sequence to derive F Ionian, though, we start with F, whole step to G, whole step to A, and then we need a note between A and B. We're replacing the note B, so this time we call it B&flat;, not A&sharp;:

* F Ionian: F G A B&flat; C D E

You can also create major scales *starting* on the new "between" notes (the *accidentals*). The B&flat; Major scale really is a thing, for example. No further new notes are required, but you'll start using the &flat; names for the *accidentals* more often.

Note that the A&flat; Major scale is a *very* different thing from the A minor scale (AKA A Aeolian).

Even today we only have twelve unique notes: seven *natural* notes and five *accidentals*.

## Note function

The **names** of notes are absolute. They never change, no matter what scale, melody, or chord you're playing. C is always called C. The note D is always called D (and can always be found two frets higher than any C on the fretboard).

It's a little confusing that the *accidental* notes have two names, but G&sharp; and A&flat; is *the same note* for example. That note will *always* be called by one of those names, no matter the context.

The *function* of a note, however, is relative and changes depending on context. Because function naming also uses the sharp/flat convention, this can be confusing to say the least!

Functional names *differ* from the absolute name of a note. This confuses the heck out of everyone when they first start studying music.

### Scale degrees

One functional name for notes are *scale degrees*. Scale degrees are numbered relative to a given note (known as the "root" of the scale) and the type of scale. **Scale degrees change depending on which note is considered the root of the scale**.

The C Major scale, for example, comprises the seven notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B in that order. C is the root note and 1st scale degree. D is the second scale degree, E the 3rd, etc.

If someone says "play the flat &flat;5" and you are playing in C Major, they are telling you to play the *note* G&flat; ("the 5" or the 5th scale degree, flattened by one semitone).

However! The note "G" is only called the 5th scale degree in C Major. If we were in the key of A minor, we would call G the minor seventh (or &flat;7 sometimes written as m7) scale degree. The scale degree depends on the key.

### Intervals

*Intervals* are the other functional name for notes. An interval is the distance between pairs of notes. The interval from the note C up to the note D, for example, is called a Major 2nd.

Unfortunately, interval names confuse people for several reasons:

1. The interval between the same two notes *depends on which note is higher in pitch*. C up to D is a Major 2nd, but D up to the next higher C is a minor 7th.

2. Confusing things even further, guitarists often move notes into different octaves to simplify fingering: technically, a note moved to a lower octave might become a minor 7th, but it's common to still think of it as a Major 2nd.

3. Actually, even that's a lie. When we start discussing harmony, specifically extended chords, the extended notes are in a higher octave and called 9ths, 11ths, and 13s instead of 2nds, 4ths, and 6ths. That note in point 2 is more commonly called "the 9th" rather than the "Major 2nd".

4. Some intervals have *multiple* names. Just as F# is also known as Gb, the interval from C to the note F#/Gb, for example, can be called an "augmented 4th" or a "diminished 5th" depending on context. To confuse you even further, that specific interval is also known as a "tritone" and is nicknamed "the blue note" as well as "the devils interval" (*diabolus in musica*).

Sadly, interval naming is just a mess. The names do tend to work in practice, but occasional confusion is unavoidable. **When in doubt, use the absolute note name!**

Here is the name of each interval relative the note C:

#### Interval Names

| Note Names | # Frets from C | Interval name(s) from C | Interval up to higher C
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| C | 0 | Unison | Octave
| C&sharp;/D&flat; | 1 | minor 2nd (m2) | Major 7th (M7)
| D | 2 | Major 2nd (M2) | minor 7th (m7)
| D&sharp;/E&flat; | 3 | minor 3rd/augmented 2nd (m3/+2) | Major 6th (M6)
| E | 4 | Major 3rd (M3) | minor 6th (m6)
| F  | 5 | perfect 4th (p4) | perfect 5th (p5)
| F&sharp;/G&flat;  | 6 | augmented 4th/diminished 5th/tritone (+4/-5)| augmented 4th/diminished 5th/tritone (+4/-5)
| G | 7 | perfect 5th (p5) | perfect 4th (p4)
| G&sharp;/A&flat;  | 8 | minor 6th/augmented 5th (m6/+5) | Major 3rd (M3)
| A  | 9 | Major 6th (M6) | minor 3rd/augmented 2nd (m3/+2)
| A&sharp;/B&flat; | 10 | minor 7th/augmented 6th (m7/+6) | Major 2nd (M2)
| B  | 11 | Major 7th | minor 2nd (m2)
| C  | 12 | Octave | Unison

Notes:

* You can mostly ignore the last column in that table, but it's worth knowing that the minor/major "quality" of an interval flips when going up to the next higher root. It's also worthwhile to know the numbers always add up to 9 (e.g. minor 3rd / Major 6th depending on direction).

* The exceptions are the "perfect" intervals, the 4th and 5th. They are neither major nor minor, so the quality doesn't flip no matter which direction you go.

* Flattening a perfect interval produces a "diminished" interval, but flattening a Major interval makes it minor, not diminished.

* Sharpening a minor interval makes it major.

* Sharpening Major *or* perfect intervals makes them augmented.

* The tritone of F#/Gb is exactly halfway between Cs in two different octaves. It's the *only* interval that stays the same whether you coming up from a lower C, or going up to a higher one. It's this unbalanced, neither here nor there, nature that gives it its "blue note" quality.

## Summary

To net it out, here are the various names of the natural notes that make up the C Major scale (these are the white keys on a piano):

### The C Major scale

| Note | Scale Degree | Steps from root | Interval from C
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| C (root) | 1 | 0 | Unison
| D | 2 | W = 2 | M2
| E | 3 | WW = 4 | M3
| F | 4 | WWh = 5 | p4
| G | 5 | WWhW = 7 | p5
| A | 6 | WWhWW = 9 | M6
| B | 7 | WWhWWW = 11 | M7
| C* | 8 | 12 | Octave
| D* | 9 | 12 + W = 14| Major Ninth
| F* | 11 | 12 + WW = 16 | Major Eleventh
| A* | 13 | 12 + WWhWW = 21 | Major Thirteenth

Notes:

1. Extensions (beyond the first octave) are marked with an asterisk. Piano players usually keep the extensions in a higher octave, but guitarists often move notes to any octave. They may think of D's in a lower octave as "ninths," for example, because of fingering restrictions.

2. In practice, you won't always think about steps up from the root. You might think "B is the Major 7 in the C Major scale," for example, but when you go to play it, it's a whole lot easier to find "down a half step from C" than "up 11 frets from C".

3. Similarly, Nobody thinks "up 14 half steps" to find the 9th! Instead, we think "two frets above the root"(since the 9th scale degree is the same note as the 2nd, the 11th the 4th, and the 13th the 6th).

4. We create chords by "stacking thirds" (taking every other note). CMaj contains the notes C E G. CMaj7 = C E G B. CMaj9 = C E G B D. CMaj11 = C E G B D F (in theory). CMaj13 = C E G B D F A (in theory &mdash; that's all seven notes in the scale!). The reason there are no 10/12/14 scale degrees is because those notes are already present in the underlying, non-extended chords. You wouldn't call an E in a higher register a "10th," it's still a Major 3rd relative to C, no matter what octave its in.

So if, for example, you were playing a song in the key of C Major, you could refer to the note E as "the third of the scale," or "the major 3rd.".

### Chord naming

One final source of much confusion: the **chords** associated with a scale also have numbers and major/minor/diminished/augmented tonality.

C Major contains the **notes** C D E F G A B but it also contains seven basic **chords** (or "triads"). By starting note in the scale in turn, we form the basic "triad" by taking every other note. So the "diatonic" chords in C Major are:

| Chord name | Roman or "Nashville" notation | Notes
| --- | --- | ---
| C | I | C E G
| Dm | ii | D F A
| Em | iii | E G B
| F | IV | F A C
| G | V | G B D
| Am | vi | A C E
| Bdim | vii° | B D F

So the chord F (Major) for example, is called the IV chord, and the note F is the 4th degree of the scale.

By convention, we use upper case roman numerals (I, IV, etc.) for major chords, lower case roman numerals (ii, vi) for minor chords, and Arabic numerals (1, 3, 5, etc.) for notes/intervals/scale-degrees.

This helps considerably in written material, but it can be amazingly difficult to hear the difference in spoken words!

It's up to the listener to figure out if people are talking about chords or notes.

Here's a totally made up band discussion, for example:

**Guitar**: I really like the sound of a minor 9th on the "two" (ii) chord here.
: Translation: adding the note E to Dm sounds cool.

**Bass**: You want me to hit the 9?
: Translation: Shall I play an E?

**Guitar**: Nah, I'll put it on top. Riff on the third instead.
: Translation: Emphasize the note F, the m3 instead.

**Drummer**: You're both rushing, tighten up.
: Translation: I need a beer.


Believe it or not, all of this will eventually make sense.

## It's okay to just **KNOW** seven notes everywhere

Eventually, we want to **KNOW** the locations for all twelve notes, everywhere on the fretboard. What makes it difficult is that the guitar can produce the *same* note at *multiple* locations. On my 24 fret electric guitar, for example, I can play an E in *thirteen* different locations!

Fortunately, it's enough just to learn the locations of the seven natural notes. The "between" notes (the "sharps and flats") will always be just one fret lower or higher. If you know where to find the note F, for example, and someone asks you to play an F#, it's okay to just find an F and move your finger one fret higher.

This isn't really **KNOWING** the location, but in practice a one fret move relative to another note you truly **KNOW** doesn't require too much mental effort, and can be done in time, even at fast tempos!.

This concludes the background material. Let's [get on with actually learning the notes](#TODO)!
