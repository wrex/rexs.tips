To play guitar well, I believe you should be able to find any natural note anywhere on the fretboard instantly and effortlessly.

Unfortunately, this is a surprisingly steep early step to learning the instrument (and it really should be the very first thing you do after learning a few chords and strumming patterns).

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}
This page is **purely theory** with no practice lessons. It's intended as introductory material that you'll likely want to refer back to periodically.

To start learning how to actually find and play the notes on the fretboard, please skip this page for now and proceed directly to [finding the notes](#TODO). You can always return to this page later.

### Shapes versus notes

A surprising number of guitarists never learn where all the notes are on the fretboard, much less how to read music. This is a real shame. Musicians learning almost any other instrument **start** by associating written notes on the staff with where and how to produce those notes on their instrument. It’s an odd quirk and unfortunate side-effect of a guitar’s layout that it's common to start making music without ever learning the notes.

The guitar's design encourages students to learn and think about fingering shapes rather than *notes*.

Many beginners think that a C major chord is this shape and only this shape:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/cmajor-open.png" title="C Major, Open Position" width="33%" >}}

But **shapes aren't music**.

That diagram only shows just *one* way to play a C Major.

By definition, C Major is formed when you play the three notes C, E, and G simultaneously. The shape above is just one way to play those notes. From left to right (starting on the 5th string) the shape above sounds the *notes* C, E, G, C (again), and E (again). It's because those three notes are the only ones sounding that make this a C chord, not the shape.

Seriously, even small children learning piano can soon play a C major chord several different ways all over the keyboard. Literally millions of guitarists, though, never learn any way other than the diagram above, which is sad.

Music comprises just three things: rhythm, melody (individual notes spaced out in time), and harmony (notes played together). Melody and harmony use *notes* so it's important to know where they all are!

Shapes aren't all bad. Shapes make it much, much easier for guitarists to play in different keys, for example. This is much more difficult on other instruments. A guitarist is *much* more likely to play in a horn player's natural key (like F or Bb) than for a horn player to play in E, A, D or G (convenient keys for the guitar).

While shapes can be a useful device to help you memorize and find notes/scales/chords, it's important not to think of them as an end in themselves.

## Why bother?

Why learn the notes on the fretboard? Several reasons, but chief among them:

* It makes learning the instrument easier.

* It indirectly improves your *ear*. Knowing which note is which makes it much easier to start hearing relationships between notes.

* It makes it much easier to communicate with other musicians.

* It makes learning music theory much, much easier. Learning theory in turn makes it easier to understand how songs are constructed, remember them, anticipate chords and melodies, and even to write your own.

* Once you know the notes within any given chord, it makes it much easier to "see" chords all over the fretboard. As we saw, a C Major chord **isn't** just the one shape you learned in open position. Once you can find the notes C, E, and G everywhere on the fretboard instantly and effortlessly, your rhythm guitar accompaniment will improve dramatically.

* The same thing holds true with scales and modes. Learning the notes makes it much easier to solo and improvise. You’ll spend less mental effort as you make music.

* It makes learning to read sheet music possible. I'm still ridiculously slow at reading, and learning to read on guitar *is* harder than many other instruments (because the same note can be played in so many different places) but it’s not impossible. It's a whole lot easier when you already know where the notes are on the fretboard!


## **KNOWING** is more than knowing

Really knowing the location of a note someplace on the fretboard, by the way, means knowing it as well as you know letters of the alphabet, the names and colors of fruits, or names and nicknames of friends and family members.

It means: given a note name, you can instantly, *effortlessly* find that note all over the fretboard (at one or two locations on each string).

It means: after plunking a finger down anywhere on the fretboard, you instantly, *effortlessly* know the name of the note at that location and the name of the other notes nearby.

I call this **KNOWING** the note (all caps and bold).

Just like when you hear “green” you immediately visualize the color, hearing "C" should light up several locations on the fretboard in your mind's eye.

It’s not enough to be able to eventually work out the note by using interval shapes or counting up/down from another fret or string. **KNOWING** means you can directly recall without effort.

Even the slight mental effort of figuring out locations relative to something else you do **KNOW** will get in the way as you start doing more advanced things (like forming multi-note chords and chord progressions).

## A few words about practicing

It will, unfortunately, take quite a bit of time (weeks to months) to **KNOW** the notes on the fretboard. But once you know (instantly and effortlessly) the name and location of every note on the fretboard the entire process of learning how to play the instrument gets easier.

Even just five minutes or so of daily practice will make the process pretty painless, but you just can't escape *several* weeks or months of practice.

Don’t let “months” scare you: by the end of just the first *day* you should be able to instantly find any natural note (the notes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) anywhere on the top or bottom strings. This means that by the end of day one, you'll have likely memorized one third of the fretboard!

The notes on the remaining four strings take so much more time because the effort is cumulative: each new note on each new string makes it progressively harder to remember what you've already learned.

## The musical alphabet

What follows is an over-simplified, highly condensed, and likely wrong history, but the concepts may prove helpful as we proceed.

I'm hoping that it answers some common questions, like:

Why are there 12 notes, but only 7 get a letter?
: Because the most important scales in Western music, especially the Major Scale, have seven notes with each note separated from the other by different intervals. Following the same interval pattern, but starting on different notes leads to "in between" notes.


Why do some notes have two names (like Eb/D#)?
: Mostly because we want each of the seven notes in a "diatonic" key to be labled A-G. The key of F, for example, comprises the notes F, G, A, B&flat;, C, D, and E. It would be weird to call the note A&sharp; instead of B&flat; when playing a song in that key, as you'd have two "A" notes. Also, sometimes you want to alter a chord for different textures. "The Hendrix chord," for example, sharpens the 9th in the chord so we use &sharp;. A "half diminished" chord lowers the 5th a half step, so we use &flat;.

Why isn't there a note called Cb or E#?
: See the section on diatonic scales below. No matter which note you start on, you never need a note between B/C or between E/F.

What does diatonic mean?
: See below.


Why did my piano teacher start the major scale at C and not A?
: Most simply because early music was mostly minor. The notes A, B, C, D, E, F can either be considered the A minor scale or the C Major scale.


### Diatonic scales

In the earliest days of Western music (think Gregorian Chants) there were just seven notes. They were eventually named A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, but they could have been named John, Paul, George, Ringo, Larry, Moe, and Curly. They were just *names*.

Each note had its own pitch or tone, and each note in the sequence had a pitch that was higher than the prior one. The note B had a slightly higher pitch than A, and G was almost, but not quite, double the pitch of A.

Today, if you *exactly* double (or halve) the pitch of any given note, the resultant tone still keeps the same name. The tone produced at 440 Hz is called "A" but so are the tones at 880 Hz, 220 Hz, and 1760 Hz. They are all just the note "A". (Look up "equal temperament" if you're curious about why this wasn't always true.)

It's important to realize that the pitches between each of the seven notes were **not** equally spaced. The spacing was originally based on integer ratios like 3:2 and 5:4 that were pleasing to the ear. The resulting tones were roughly the same as those produced by the white keys on a piano today, including a smaller interval between B and C, and between E and F than between any of the other notes.

The seven notes produce successively higher pitches, and repeated indefinitely: A B C D E F G A B C D E F G A .... (This is why it's called an "octave," by the way &mdash; the sequence repeats at the eighth note.)

This uneven spacing of seven notes eventually became known as a "diatonic" scale. It was called "diatonic" ("two tones") because the distance between any two consecutive notes was either a whole step (a "tone") or a half step (a "semitone").

### Triads

Because of this uneven spacing, the sound/feeling of note groupings *changes* as you play different groups of notes. This is particularly true when playing notes at the same time (harmony) but is also true with melodies (individual notes played sequentially in time).

The most important note groupings are called "triads," three note groupings where you play every other note: A/C/E, B/D/F, C/E/G, etc.

Playing every other note starting from A (the notes A, C, E) sounds vaguely sad, but playing every other note starting on C (C, E, G) sounds somewhat happy, for example.

If we start with C, there is a whole step to D, another whole step to E, a half step to F, whole steps from G to B, then another half step to begin another sequence starting with a higher C. This ordering of tone intervals (W W h W W W h) has a characteristic sound or feel that today we call "major" or "Ionian mode" if we're feeling fancy. It has a vaguely happy sound.

If instead, we start with A, though, the intervals become W h W W h W W with a characteristic feel we call "minor" or "Aeolian mode". Again, this sounds vaguely sad to most people.

If you start with G, you're in "Mixolydian mode" (a great mode for soloing over the blues today, but I'm doubtful that any Gregorian blues chants survive).

### Modes

The uneven spacing results in seven different "modes" for precisely **the same collection of seven notes**. It turns out that just by changing which note you consider the first (the "key") you can make music with very different "feels" even though you're using exactly the same notes.

Eventually, somebody thought: "But what if I want to produce (say) that sweet happy Major/Ionian sound, but starting with the note G instead of C?"

In other words, they wanted a group of seven notes that starts on G, but followed the W W h W W W h interval sequence of Ionian mode. It turns out that six of the original seven notes worked just fine, but one (F) was just wrong: G, whole-step to A, whole step to B, half step to C, whole step to D, whole step to E, but then we need a whole step to ... what?

F is only a half step above E. G is too far (one and a half steps). They needed a note halfway *between* F and G for it to sound Ionian instead of Mixolydian. Since this tone replaces F in the sequence, but wasn't F, they called it F#. It's just another name, but for a new note that wasn't used before.

### The 12 Notes

It turns out that if you go through the process of creating every mode starting on each of the seven notes you end up needing five total of these "halfway" notes (between A/B, C/D, D/E, F/G, and G/A). Including the seven original "natural" notes, you end up with 12 uniquely named notes:

1. A
2. A# or Bb
3. B
4. C
5. C# or Db (two names for the same note)
6. D
7. D# or Eb
8. E
9. F
10. F# or Gb
11. G
12. G# or Ab

These "in between" notes have two names, which can be confusing. The rule is simple, though, just use the name based on what you're replacing. In the example above, for G Ionian we replaced F so we called it F# and not Gb.

Here are the notes to create a major (Ionian) scale starting on each of the original seven notes:

* A Ionian: A B C# D E F# G# (three sharps)

* B Ionian: B C# D# E F# G# A# (five sharps)

* C Ionian: C D E F G A B (no sharps or flats)

* D Ionian: D E F# G A B C# (two sharps)

* E Ionian: E F# G# A B C# D# (four sharps)

* G Ionian: G A B C D E F# (one sharp)

For F Ionian, though, we start with F, whole step to G, whole step to A, and then we need a note between A and B. We're replacing the note B, so this time we call it Bb, not A#:

* F Ionian: F G A Bb C D E

(You can also create major scales starting on the new "between" notes, but no further new notes are required.)

Anyway, the point is that they ended up with just 12 unique notes (and only 12 unique notes, even today). Seven of them are named A through G. These are the "natural" notes. The other five are "between" notes with two possible names depending on usage (the "sharps and flats"). Again, don't get confused, these are just *names*.

We can start a scale "rooted" on any of these 12 notes, not just the seven natural notes (The Bb Major scale really is a thing, for example). Each of these 12 scales contains just seven notes, and seven different sounds (or modes) depending which of the seven notes you start on.

## Note function: scale degrees and intervals

The **names** of notes are absolute. They never change, no matter what scale, melody, or chord you're playing. C is always called C. The note D is always called D (and can always be found two frets higher than any C on the fretboard).

The function of a note is relative, however, and how we describe the function changes depending on context. This can be confusing to say the least.

What follows confuses everyone when they first start studying music. It's not necessary to learn the fretboard, but feel free to read through it and try to make sense of what you can. You may want to come back and re-read this material as you progress.

### Scale degrees

Notes have an absolute name as we just discussed. But they can also be named
depending on how they function *relative* to some other note. These relative
names *change* depending on context (depending on what the note is relative **to**).

One example of this are what are called *scale degrees*. Scale degrees are numbered relative to some note (known as the "root" of the scale) and according to the type of scale. **Scale degrees change depending on which note is considered the root of the scale**.

The C Major scale, for example, comprises the seven notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B in that order. C is the root note and 1st scale degree. D is the second scale degree, E the 3rd, etc. If someone says "play the flat five" and you are playig in C Major, they are telling you to play G&flat; ("the 5" or the 5th scale degree, flattened by one semitone).

However! The note "G" is only called the 5th scale degree in C Major. If we were in the key of A minor, we would call G the minor seventh scale degree. The scale degree depends on the key.

Of the seven diatonic modes, the major scale (Ionian mode) is by **far** the most important. **Scale degrees are almost always named based on the major scale.**

### Intervals

The other way of referring to notes is in terms of intervals. Intervals are always between pairs of notes. The interval from the note C up to the note D, for example, is called a Major 2nd.

Unfortunately, intervals can also be confusing for at least a couple reasons:

1. The interval between the same two notes depends on which note is higher in pitch. C up to D (two half steps) is a Major 2nd, but D up to the next higher C is a minor 7th (ten half steps). For fingering reasons, guitarists often move notes into different octaves, which can make naming intervals challenging.

2. Some intervals have multiple names. Just as F# is also known as Gb, the interval from C to the note F#/Gb, for example, can be called an "augmented 4th" or a "diminished 5th" depending on context. To confuse you even further, that specific interval is also known as a "tritone" and is nicknamed "the blue note" as well as "the devils interval" (*diabolus in musica*).

Here is the name of each interval starting with a root note of C:

| Note Names | # Frets from C | Interval name(s) from C | Interval up to higher C
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| C | 0 | Unison | Octave
| C#/Db | 1 | minor 2nd (m2) | Major 7th (M7)
| D | 2 | Major 2nd (M2) | minor 7th (m7)
| D#/Eb | 3 | minor 3rd/augmented 2nd (m3/+2) | Major 6th (M6)
| E | 4 | Major 3rd (M3) | minor 6th (m6)
| F  | 5 | perfect 4th (p4) | perfect 5th (p5)
| F#/Gb  | 6 | augmented 4th/diminished 5th/tritone (+4/-5)| augmented 4th/diminished 5th/tritone (+4/-5)
| G | 7 | perfect 5th (p5) | perfect 4th (p4)
| G#/Ab  | 8 | minor 6th/augmented 5th (m6/+5) | Major 3rd (M3)
| A  | 9 | Major 6th (M6) | minor 3rd/augmented 2nd (m3/+2)
| A#/Bb | 10 | minor 7th/augmented 6th (m7/+6) | Major 2nd (M2)
| B  | 11 | Major 7th | minor 2nd (m2)
| C  | 12 | Octave | Unison

Notes:

* You can mostly ignore the last column in that table, but it's worth knowing that the minor/major "character" of an interval flips when going up to the next higher root. It's also worthwhile to know the numbers always add up to 9 (e.g. minor 3rd / Major 6th depending on direction).

* The exceptions are the "perfect" intervals, the 4th and 5th. They are neither major nor minor, no matter which direction you go.

* Perfect intervals can be diminished by flattening a half step, but flattening a Major interval makes it minor, not diminished.

* Sharpening a minor interval makes it major.

* Sharpening Major or Perfect intervals make them augmented.

* The tritone of F#/Gb is exactly halfway between Cs in two different octaves. It's the *only* interval that stays the same whether you coming up from a lower C, or going up to a higher one. It's this unbalanced, neither here nor there, nature that gives it its "blue note" quality.

Finally, the last piece of complexity is that chord "extensions" use scale degrees that continue into the next octave.

### C Major (the natural notes)

To net it out, here are the various names of the natural notes that make up the C Major scale (these are the white keys on a piano):

| Note | Scale Degree | Steps from root | Interval from C
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| C (root) | 1 | 0 | Unison
| D | 2 | W = 2 | M2
| E | 3 | WW = 4 | M3
| F | 4 | WWh = 5 | p4
| G | 5 | WWhW = 7 | p5
| A | 6 | WWhWW = 9 | M6
| B | 7 | WWhWWW = 11 | M7
| C* | 8 | 12 | Octave
| D* | 9 | 12 + W = 14| Major Ninth
| F* | 11 | 12 + WW = 16 | Major Eleventh
| A* | 13 | 12 + WWhWW = 21 | Major Thirteenth

Notes:

1. Extensions (beyond the first octave) are marked with an asterisk. Piano players usually keep the extensions in a higher octave, but guitarists often move notes to any octave. They may think of D's in a lower octave as "ninths," for example, because of fingering restrictions.

2. In practice, you won't always think about steps up from the root. You might think "B is the Major 7 in the C Major scale," for example, but when you go to play it, it's a whole lot easier to find "down a half step from C" than "up 11 frets from C".

3. Similarly, Nobody thinks "up 14 half steps" to find the 9th! Instead, we think "two frets above the root"(since the 9th scale degree is the same note as the 2nd, the 11th the 4th, and the 13th the 6th).

4. We create chords by "stacking thirds" (taking every other note). CMaj contains the notes C E G. CMaj7 = C E G B. CMaj9 = C E G B D. CMaj11 = C E G B D F (in theory). CMaj13 = C E G B D F A (in theory &mdash; that's all seven notes in the scale!). The reason there are no 10/12/14 scale degrees is because those notes are already present in the underlying, non-extended chords. You wouldn't call an E in a higher register a "10th," it's still a Major 3rd relative to C, no matter what octave its in.

So if, for example, you were playing a song in the key of C Major, you could refer to the note E as "the third of the scale," or "the major 3rd.".

### Chord naming

One final source of much confusion: the **chords** associated with a scale also have numbers and major/minor/diminished/augmented tonality.

C Major contains the **notes** C D E F G A B but it also contains seven basic **chords** (or "triads"). By starting note in the scale in turn, we form the basic "triad" by taking every other note. So the "diatonic" chords in C Major are:

| Chord name | Roman or "Nashville" notation | Notes
| --- | --- | ---
| C | I | C E G
| Dm | ii | D F A
| Em | iii | E G B
| F | IV | F A C
| G | V | G B D
| Am | vi | A C E
| Bdim | vii° | B D F

So the chord F (Major) for example, is called the IV chord, and the note F is the 4th degree of the scale.

By convention, we use upper case roman numerals (I, IV, etc.) for major chords, lower case roman numerals (ii, vi) for minor chords, and Arabic numerals (1, 3, 5, etc.) for notes/intervals/scale-degrees.

This helps considerably in written material, but it can be amazingly difficult to hear the difference in spoken words!

It's up to the listener to figure out if people are talking about chords or notes.

Here's a totally made up band discussion, for example:

**Guitar**: I really like the sound of a minor 9th on the "two" (ii) chord here.
: Translation: adding the note E to Dm sounds cool.

**Bass**: You want me to hit the 9?
: Translation: Shall I play an E?

**Guitar**: Nah, I'll put it on top. Riff on the third instead.
: Translation: Emphasize the note F, the m3 instead.

**Drummer**: You're both rushing, tighten up.
: Translation: I need a beer.


Believe it or not, all of this will eventually make sense.

## It's okay to just **KNOW** seven notes everywhere

Eventually, we want to **KNOW** the locations for all twelve notes, everywhere on the fretboard. What makes it difficult is that the guitar can produce the *same* note at *multiple* locations. On my 24 fret electric guitar, for example, I can play an E in *thirteen* different locations!

Fortunately, it's enough just to learn the locations of the seven natural notes. The "between" notes (the "sharps and flats") will always be just one fret lower or higher. If you know where to find the note F, for example, and someone asks you to play an F#, it's okay to just find an F and move your finger one fret higher.

This isn't really **KNOWING** the location, but in practice a one fret move relative to another note you truly **KNOW** doesn't require too much mental effort, and can be done in time, even at fast tempos!.

This concludes the background material. Let's [get on with actually learning the notes](#TODO)!
