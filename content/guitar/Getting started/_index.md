The content on this site isn't terribly advanced, but it does assume some basic knowledge (like how to tune the guitar and play basic "cowboy" chords).

If you are an absolute beginner on the guitar, I **strongly** suggest you first go through a beginners course elsewhere. I think [Justin's new for 2020 beginner guitar course](https://www.justinguitar.com/categories/beginner-guitar-lessons-grade-1) is probably the best one out there.

Next, you should look at:

* This

* That

* the other things
