In addition to [knowing the notes on the fretboard]({{< ref "/guitar/2020-03-17-note-locations.md" >}}) every beginning guitarist needs to be competent at playing basic open-position major chords (the "cowboy chords").
<!--more-->

Let's follow "test driven guitar" and start with the proficiency test we are aiming for:

<a name="TDG002"></a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="TDG001 Cowboy Chords" details=true >}}
Set a metronome to 60 BPM.

This test uses the open position major chords (the "cowboy chords"):

1. B7 (alternately a B Major barre chord at the second fret)
2. E
3. A
4. D
5. G
6. C
7. F

Use a simple two beat rhythm for each chord, e.g. one beat letting the notes ring, followed by a short muted strum on the second beat.

Starting with B7, play through each chord in the order above. Focus on clean sounding chords and an even rhythm.

Now repeat the progression backwards (in fifths rather than fourths), starting with F.

Finally, repeat the chords in alphabetic order (it won't sound very musical): A, B7, C, D, E, F, G.

Pass criteria: You can play all three chord progressions (fourths, fifths, alphabetic) cleanly and in time at 60 BPM with chord changes every whole note.

The goal is to become proficient playing at least one shape of every major chord in open position (ignoring roots with flats and sharps).

Here are the seven "cowboy chords":

Even beginners should be familiar with these chord shapes. Please refer to a beginner guitar site if you are just getting started with guitar. You'll be hard pressed to find a better one than [Justin Sandercoe's](https://www.justinguitar.com/categories/beginner-guitar-lessons-grade-1).

Practice playing each of those chord shapes individually as well as moving between them. When you feel ready, see if you can make it through [TDG002](#TDG002) without any mistakes.

With just these seven chords you can accompany thousands of songs. They will get play any I-IV-V progression in a major "guitar key" (the keys of E, A, D, G, and C major).

Have fun!
