This is part 2 of a two part series about learning the notes on the fretboard.

Unlike the [previous post]({{< ref "/guitar/2019-02-11-just-12-notes.md" >}}), we are now going to get our hands and muscle memory going &mdash; enough theory!
<!--more-->

## The end goal

Try not to be intimidated, but here is what we are eventually going to learn. You'll eventually be able to find and name every single note in this diagram *effortlessly*:

<a name="figure-1"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/natural-notes.png" title="Fig. 1: The natural notes" >}}

I'm not going to kid you, it's *hard* to really **KNOW** all those notes. It will take weeks or months of real practice, but *everything* gets easier once you've learned the note locations. It's progressive, too: the better you know the notes the easier things get, but even if you can only find a few notes (say those on just the E strings) you'll still find it amazingly helpful.

{{< admonition type="warning" title="Always tune up!" details=false >}}
Always tune your guitar at the beginning of **every** practice session. You are training your ears as much as your fingers, and it's important for you to practice with the right notes. Eventually you'll automagically learn to *hear* when you are out of tune (and even whether you are sharp or flat) but to get there you need to always ensure you are in tune.
{{< /admonition >}}

I'm going to use this as my first trial run of "Test Driven Guitar" and work backward from the end goal. Here's the final test that we are working toward. If you can't pass this test right now, you can't say you **KNOW** the notes on the fretboard:

<a name="TDG001">&nbsp;</a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="TDG001 Fretboard Notes" details=true >}}
1. Set a metronome to 60 BPM. We will be playing half notes (two clicks per note).

2. Progress through the entire circle of fourths, finding and playing each note on the first 12 frets.

First you will find the note B on every string, then note E, and so on, finishing with the note G&flat;.

For each note, first play ascending from the lowest string to the highest string, playing the note on each string in turn. **Then return descending** playing first on the thinnest string and progressing to the thickest. For some strange reason, going in both directions seems to assist with memorization.

Pass criteria: Successfully work through all 12 notes while keeping time and without any flubs or misses. It's okay to wait up to a full bar before moving onto the next note in the cycle-of-fourths, but you must play each note on all six string in half note time without missing a beat.

## The Process

Like anything with guitar, the way to make this tractable is to break it into small, ridiculously easy chunks, and keep practicing the chunks that give you trouble (and not repeat the ones you've already mastered!). Again, expect this to take take weeks at best. Expect to begin all of your practice sessions with some of the GTD tests on this page until you can pass [TDG001](#TDG001).

Follow this process to get to the end goal:

1. Memorize the cycle of fourths.
2. Learn the open strings and notes at the 5th and 12th frets.
3. Learn the notes on the lowest (E) string.
4. Learn some octave shapes to find notes.
5. Practice on one string at a time.
6. Practice [TDG001](#TDG001) at the beginning of each practice session until you have it nailed. Repeat step 5 for any strings that give you trouble.

Spend as much time as you need on each of these steps. The first few will only take a few minutes to master, but other steps may take days, weeks, or even months. Take your time. Thorough and confident beats quick and sketchy every day.

### 1. The cycle of fourths

As described in the previous post, an interval of a perfect fourth (P4) is five frets, or five half steps. If you start on the note C, going up a perfect fourth arrives at the note F, for example.

Fourths are extremely common in music, however, especially in chord progressions. It's way, *way*, **way** to much effort to figure out this every time. Instead, it's well worth your time to simply use rote memorization to remember the sequence.

First, remember the word "bead" and how to spell it.

Now regress to middle school and remember the acronym for "greatest common factor", GCF.

Put them together and you've got most of the sequence: B E A D G C F.

That's just seven notes, though. The complete cycle of fourths includes flatted versions of the first five notes: B E A D G C F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; D&flat; G&flat;, in that order, and then continues around to B again.

For reasons I won't go into now, it's good to visualize this sequence as the numbers on a clock face. Start with the B at the 7 o\'clock position, and the C at the top. Like this:

<a name="figure-2"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/fourths-clock.png" caption="Fig. 2: Cycle of Fourths Clock" width="33%" >}}

<a name="TDG002">&nbsp;</a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="TDG002 • Reciting notes in fourths" details=true >}}
This one is really simple.

Just practice saying the full 12 note cycle of fourths *out loud* a few times: B E A D G C F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; D&flat; G&flat;. Keep looping around from G&flat; to B and continue the cycle.

Once you are bored with that practice starting on different notes within the sequence and continuing around the "clock" (without looking at the image above of course!). Starting at F, for example, say *out loud* "F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; ...."

Pass criteria:

1. You can answer any of the following *effortlessly*:
    * What's after D?
    * What's after A&flat;?

2. You can start on any of the 12 notes and effortlessly recite the cycle of fourths starting on that note.

<a name="TDG003">&nbsp;</a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="TDG003 • Reciting notes in fifths" details=true >}}
This one is also pretty easy, but trickier than fourths.

Instead of going clockwise around the clock, we are going to practice moving in fifths by moving *counter*-clockwise.

Practice saying the full 12 note cycle of fifths *out loud* a few times, starting at F: F G C D A E B G&flat; D&flat; A&flat; E&flat; B&flat;. Keep looping around from B&flat; to F and continue the cycle.

Once you are bored with that practice starting on different notes within the sequence and continuing backward around the "clock" (without looking at the image above of course!). Starting at C, for example, say *out loud* "D A E B G&flat; D&flat; ...."

Pass criteria:

1. You can answer any of the following *effortlessly*:
    * What's before D on the "clock"?
    * What's before A&flat; on the "clock"?

2. You can start on any of the 12 notes and effortlessly recite the cycle of fifths starting on that note.

### 2. Open string notes

From lowest (thickest) string to highest (thinnest) the guitar is normally tuned to the notes E, A, D, G, B, and E. From the previous section, you should realize that each string is tuned a fourth higher than the last.

Except something weird happens when going from the third string to the second: C is a fourth higher than G, but the string is tuned to B. G to B is an interval of a Major third, not a perfect fourth. This was done to make it easier to finger most chords, but just memorize these notes: E A D G B e. Note that the highest string is tuned exactly two octaves higher than the lowest.

Practice plucking random open strings and saying the note name *out loud* for a few minutes. (Believe it or not, saying the names out loud helps your brain remember the names.)

Now fret the strings at the 12th fret and prove to yourself that the notes sound the same, only one octave higher. The thickest string played at the 12th fret is still an E, just one octave higher (the string vibrates at twice the frequency).

Finally, look at [figure 1](#figure-1) again, focusing specifically on the fifth fret. Notice that the sixth string at the fifth fret is the note A, the same note as the open fifth string. Same with the D a the 5th fret of the fifth string.

It holds for all the strings except for the third and second string. Again, standard tuning makes everything shift by a fret when moving between the second and third strings.

At the 5th fret the notes are A D G C E a. Practice playing these notes at the 5th fret and saying the names out loud.

I'm not creating any tests for these, since it should only take a few minutes to memorize the notes at the fifth and 12th frets.

Please don't continue until you are 100% confident you **KNOW** these notes, however.

### 3. Notes on the sixth string

We learned in [the last post]({{< ref "/guitar/2019-02-11-just-12-notes.md" >}}) that the major scale comprises the intervals whole-step, whole-step, half-step, whole-step, whole-step, whole-step, half-step.

In other words, there is a whole step (two frets) between any two natural notes except E/F and B/C.

Since the open sixth string is the note E, this leads directly to this diagram:

<a name="figure-3"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/e6-string.png" caption="Fig. 3: Notes on the E string"  >}}

Spend a few minutes just saying each natural note name out loud as you play each note, ascending up and descending down the frets. Try to do be "mindful" as you don this. The goal is to connect the note names with the fret locations in your brain and muscle memory.

Once you are comfortable just moving up and down the scale linearly, try the following GTD test:

<a name="TDG004">&nbsp;</a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="TDG004 • Notes on E string" details=true >}}
Work through the cycle of fourths, finding and playing each note on the sixth string. For the note E, you can either play the open string or at the 12th fret. First play B, then E, then A, *etc.*

First practice this rubato (out of time &mdash; don't worry about a metronome). Just take your time and try to ensure you are playing the correct note each time.

When you are comfortable with that, set your metronome to 60 BPM and practice finding the notes of the cycle *in time* by playing half notes (two clicks per note).

Pass criteria: You can play the entire 12 note cycle of fourths in time on the E string without making any mistakes.

Extra credit: Repeat the exercise using the cycle of *fifths*.
{{< /admonition >}}

TODO: Video demonstration of TDG004.

Note that the notes on the high E string are exactly the same (of course) as the ones on the low E string. Once you **KNOW** the open strings and the E string notes, you've got over half of the fretboard covered!

### 4. Octave shapes

We are now going to learn a trick for finding notes from locations we already know. The shapes used for this trick are extremely useful and you'll use them forever, but please understand that you don't really **KNOW** the fretboard until you no longer need to rely on this trick. It is just a temporary crutch to assist you as you progress.

Let's channel our inner Marie Kondo and de-clutter [figure 1](#figure-1) a bit. The root or tonic of the C Major scale brings *me* joy, so let's focus on that note first:

<a name="figure-4"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/c-notes.png" title="Fig. 4: C Everywhere on the Fretboard" >}}

It should be obvious if you think about it, but the note C exists in only one location on each string between frets 1 and 12.

We already know how to find the C's by counting up or down from notes we already know on the same string, but there's another way: using shapes/patterns that go across strings.

### 4.1. Octave shape 1

Here's our first **octave shape**:

<a name="figure-5"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/octave-shape-1.png" title="Fig. 5: Octave shape 1" >}}

If we already **KNOW** a note on string 6, we can find the same note on string 4 with a little zig-zag: two strings higher and two frets higher. The C at fret 8 on the the E string leads us to the C at the 10th fret of the D string.

The same thing works on the 5th string (the grey notes): We **KNOW** that C is on the 3rd fret of the A string, so we can navigate (dead reckon) to the C at the 5th fret of the G string. (Of course, you should already **KNOW** that note since it's on the fifth fret, but it's nice to have confirmation.)

What about the higher strings? Let's look at the octave shapes between the G and high-E strings, and between the D and B strings.

<a name="figure-6"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/octave-shape-1a.png" title="Fig. 6: Octave shape 1a" >}}

At first glance, this shape may look different than the previous one, but it's important to realize that they are the same shape, even though there's an additional fret between the notes.

Because of the tuning anomaly between the G and B strings, we have to move up an extra fret whenever a shape spans the gap between those strings. When navigating from the C at the 5th fret of the G string, we find the C on the 1st string up *three* frets, not two, on the 8th fret.

Same thing with the C at the 10th fret of the D string. The C on the B string is two strings, and *three* frets higher at fret 13 on the B string.

Two very important points about this first octave shape:

* It works, of course, for *any* note, not just C. Look again at the diagram with all the natural notes: any given note exists two strings higher, and two or three frets higher depending on whether it crosses the G-B string boundary.

* It also, of course, works in *both* directions. If you **KNOW** a note on a higher string, you can find the same note two strings and two or three frets *lower*.

This first octave shape is particularly advantageous if you follow the recommended "one finger per fret" technique. If you put your pinky finger on any note on the high E string, you can find the same note on the G string under your first finger (or vice versa).

If you place your first finger on any note on the fifth or sixth strings, the same note can be found under your third finger two frets higher (or vice versa). Same thing in reverse for notes on the 1sth string, only now with your pinky on the first string the same note is under your index finger two strings lower.

So we can use octave 1a to find notes on the 3rd and 4th strings. Just two more strings to go!

### 4.2. Octave shape 2

The next octave shape skips two strings, not just one:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/octave-shape-2.png" title="Octave shape 2" >}}

Starting from the C at fret 8 on the low E string, we can find another C going over three strings higher and then *down* three frets. Again, this works in both directions. If, for example, you **KNOW** a note on the G string, you can find the same note on the low E string by moving up three frets higher.

The "2a" shapes are shown in grey this time. Because we are skipping two strings in this shape, there are two "2a" shapes and only one "2" shape.

Again, whenever you cross the boundary between the 2nd and 3rd strings, you need to adjust by one fret. If you're going up the strings (toward the thinner strings) you raise the higher note. So moving from the C at the 3rd fret of the A string, you only go down two frets and find the C on the 1st fret of the B string.

Going the other way from the C on the 8th fret of the high E, you find C on the D string at the 10th fret (going *up* two frets).

Most of the time when playing live, your natural inclination is to move your hand up the neck to play higher and down the neck to play lower. It's thus more common to use octave shapes 1 most of the time. When you "run out of neck," though, it can be useful to continue ascending or descending by skipping another string.

Practice finding notes on different strings using these four octave shapes. Be sure to use the shapes in both directions (moving from a lower note to a higher, and vice versa).

<a name="TDG005">&nbsp;</a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="TDG005 • Octave Shapes" details=true >}}
As usual, our proficiency pace is half notes at 60 BPM. As always, try it without a metronome first.

Instead of the cycle of fourths, we'll just use the open string notes: EADGBe. The test is to use octave shapes to move both up and down the fretboard to find notes.

Starting with the open E on the sixth string. Say "E" out loud as you pluck the open string. Next use octave shape 1 to move up the fretboard. Play and say "E" at the 2nd fret of the D string. Then use shape 1a to move up another octave to the 5th fret of the 2nd string.

We can't continue onto thinner strings because we are out of strings, so use shape 2a to find the E on the 5th string at the 7th fret. (Technically, this E is in a lower octave even though you are moving up the fretboard.)

We can't continue onto thicker strings, so back to shape 1 and play the E at the 9th fret of the 3rd string.

Finally, shape 1a onto the 12th fret of the high E string.

We've now played an E on all six strings.

[As an aside: we played E in three different octaves. Every time we used shape 1 or 1a we moved up an octave, but when we used shape 2 we went back *down* an octave.]

Now we are going to start with the A at the 12th fret. Play and say "A" there, then use shape 2 to find the A on the 2nd string at the 10th fret. Continue the zigzag patter back down the fretboard until you reach the open A on the 5th string.

Repeat the exercise for the remaining open string (or 12th fret) notes: G, B, and the high E string.

Pass criteria: You can use octave shapes to play every open string note everywhere on the fretboard at 60 BPM with half notes.
{{< /admonition >}}

TODO: Video demonstration of TDG005.

### 5. One string at a time

Now that you know the octave shapes you can use them as a temporary crutch for learning the notes on other strings.

Let's tackle the D string next. Refer back to [figure 1](#figure-1) if necessary. You already **KNOW** that the open string is D, the 5th fret is G, and the 12th fret is another D.

If the open string is D, then E must be at the second fret, and F at the third fret. If G is at the fifth fret, then A is at the seventh, B at the ninth, and C at the tenth.

Practice playing the natural notes just going up and down from the lower D on the open string to the higher D at the 12th fret. As always, say the note names **out loud**.

Once you can easily ascend and descend alphabetically through the natural notes, try to mix it up by going in fourths: first play B, then E, then A, etc.

You'll probably find that you need to use octave shape 1 as a reminder occasionally. Remember that this is just a crutch, though. Eventually you want to associate each note name with a string/fret location directly. Even one or two **KNOWN** "landmarks" can help tremendously when navigating.

Once you think you've got it down, test yourself with a metronome (half notes at 60 BPM). You don't know 'em as well as you thought you did, do you? (laugh)

Once you've got the D string licked, move on to other strings the same way.

You'll need to learn the low E and low A strings by rote, but you can use the octave shapes to help you on the other strings.

<a name="TDG006">&nbsp;</a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="TDG006 • Notes on individual strings" details=true >}}
This test is just a repeat of [TDG004](#TDG004) only instead of just using the 6th string, you are now going to play the full cycle of fourths along **every** string.

Pass criteria: You can play the complete cycle of fourths on every string with half notes at 60 BPM without any hesitation or flubbed notes.
{{< /admonition >}}

TODO: Video demonstration of TDG006.

### 6. Putting it all together

Once you can play the cycle of fourths on each string individually, it's time to start practicing [TDG001](#TDG001) for in it's entirety.

You'll be finding each note on **all** of the strings at once. You may find this quite challenging at first.

I *strongly* recommend you practice this without a metronome for the first several days. Build up good landmarks in your brain before trying to play in time: the metronome is a harsh taskmaster!

When you're ready though, set the metronome to a nice s-l-o-w tempo and try playing whole notes at first. Then half notes. For a real challenge, try playing quarter notes at a quick tempo (say 100 BPM).

This is one of those drills that may take years to master. The goal is to know the notes like the back of your hand, but if you can perform [TDG001](#TDG001) with half notes at 60 BPM, you'll know the fretboard well enough to tackle almost any challenge (and better than many guitarists who have been playing for *years*).

[TDG001](#TDG001) is an excellent warm up exercise, and I still perform it at the beginning of almost every practice sessions. It only takes a minute or two.

Enjoy!
