This is part 2 of a two part series about learning the notes on the fretboard.

Unlike the [previous post]({{< ref "/guitar/2019-02-11-just-12-notes.md" >}}), we are now going to get our hands and muscle memory going &mdash; enough theory!
<!--more-->

## The end goal

Try not to be intimidated, but here is what we are eventually going to learn. You'll eventually be able to find and name every single note in this diagram *effortlessly*:

<a name="Fig 1."></a>
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/natural-notes.png" title="Fig 1. The natural notes" >}}

I'm not going to kid you, it's *hard* to really **KNOW** all those notes. It will take weeks or months of real practice, but *everything* gets easier once you've learned the note locations. It's progressive, too: the better you know the notes the easier things get, but even if you can only find a few notes (say those on just the E strings) you'll still find it amazingly helpful.

{{< admonition type="warning" title="Always tune up!" details=false >}}
Always tune your guitar at the beginning of **every** practice session. You are training your ears as much as your fingers, and it's important for you to practice with the right notes. Eventually you'll automagically learn to *hear* when you are out of tune (and even whether you are sharp or flat) but to get there you need to always ensure you are in tune.
{{< /admonition >}}

I'm going to use this as my first trial run of "Test Driven Guitar" and work backward from the end goal. Here's the final test that we are working toward. If you can't pass this test right now, you can't say you **KNOW** the notes on the fretboard:

<a name="GTD-Notes.final"></a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="GTD-Notes.final" details=true >}}
1. Set a metronome to 60 BPM. We will be playing half notes (two clicks per note).

2. Progress through the entire circle of fourths, finding and playing each note on the first 12 frets.

First you will find the note B on every string, then note E, and so on, finishing with the note G&flat;.

For each note, first play ascending from the lowest string to the highest string, playing the note on each string in turn. **Then return descending** playing first on the thinnest string and progressing to the thickest. For some strange reason, going in both directions seems to assist with memorization.

Pass criteria: Successfully work through all 12 notes while keeping time and without any flubs or misses. It's okay to wait up to a full bar before moving onto the next note in the cycle-of-fourths, but you must play each note on all six string in half note time without missing a beat.

## Process overview

Like anything with guitar, the way to make this tractable is to break it into small, ridiculously easy chunks, and keep practicing the chunks that give you trouble (and not repeat the ones you've already mastered!). Again, expect this to take take weeks at best. Expect to begin all of your practice sessions with some of the GTD tests on this page until you can pass [GTD-Notes.final](#GTD-Notes.final).

Follow this process to get to the end goal:

1. Memorize the cycle of fourths.
2. Learn the open strings and notes at the 5th and 12th frets.
3. Learn the notes on the lowest (E) string.
4. Learn some octave shapes to find notes.
5. Practice on one string at a time.
6. Practice [GTD-Notes.final](#GTD-Notes.final) at the beginning of each practice session until you have it nailed. Repeat step 5 for any strings that give you trouble.

Spend as much time as you need on each of these steps. The first few will only take a few minutes to master, but other steps may take days, weeks, or even months. Take your time. Thorough and confident beats quick and sketchy every day.

### 1. The cycle of fourths

As described in the previous post, an interval of a perfect fourth (P4) is five frets, or five half steps. If you start on the note C, going up a perfect fourth arrives at the note F, for example.

Fourths are extremely common in music, however, especially in chord progressions. It's way, *way*, **way** to much effort to figure out this every time. Instead, it's well worth your time to simply use rote memorization to remember the sequence.

First, remember the word "bead" and how to spell it.

Now regress to middle school and remember the acronym for "greatest common factor", GCF.

Put them together and you've got most of the sequence: B E A D G C F.

That's just seven notes, though. The complete cycle of fourths includes flatted versions of the first five notes: B E A D G C F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; D&flat; G&flat;, in that order, and then continues around to B again.

For reasons I won't go into now, it's good to visualize this sequence as the numbers on a clock face. Start with the B at the 7 o\'clock position, and the C at the top. Like this:

{{< figure src="/img/fourths-clock.png" caption="Cycle of Fourths Clock" width="33%" >}}

<a name="GTD-Notes.fourths"></a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="GTD-Notes.fourths" details=true >}}
This one is really simple.

Just practice saying the full 12 note cycle of fourths *out loud* a few times: B E A D G C F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; D&flat; G&flat;. Keep looping around from G&flat; to B and continue the cycle.

Once you are bored with that practice starting on different notes within the sequence and continuing around the "clock" (without looking at the image above of course!). Starting at F, for example, say *out loud* "F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; ...."

Pass criteria:

1. You can answer any of the following *effortlessly*:
* What's after D?
* What's after A&flat?

2. You can start on any of the 12 notes and effortlessly recite the cycle of fourths starting on that note.

<a name="GTD-Notes.fifths"></a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="GTD-Notes.fifths" details=true >}}
This one is also pretty easy, but trickier than fourths.

Instead of going clockwise around the clock, we are going to practice moving in fifths by moving *counter*-clockwise.

Practice saying the full 12 note cycle of fifths *out loud* a few times, starting at F: F G C D A E B G&flat; D&flat; A&flat; E&flat; B&flat;. Keep looping around from B&flat; to F and continue the cycle.

Once you are bored with that practice starting on different notes within the sequence and continuing backward around the "clock" (without looking at the image above of course!). Starting at C, for example, say *out loud* "D A E B G&flat; D&flat; ...."

Pass criteria:

1. You can answer any of the following *effortlessly*:
* What's before D on the "clock"?
* What's before A&flat; on the "clock"?

2. You can start on any of the 12 notes and effortlessly recite the cycle of fifths starting on that note.

### 2. Open string notes

From lowest (thickest) string to highest (thinnest) the guitar is normally tuned to the notes E, A, D, G, B, and E. From the previous section, you should realize that each string is tuned a fourth higher than the last.

Except something weird happens when going from the third string to the second: C is a fourth higher than G, but the string is tuned to B. G to B is an interval of a Major third, not a perfect fourth. This was done to make it easier to finger most chords, but just memorize these notes: E A D G B e. Note that the highest string is tuned exactly two octaves higher than the lowest.

Practice plucking random open strings and saying the note name *out loud* for a few minutes. (Believe it or not, saying the names out loud helps your brain remember the names.)

Now fret the strings at the 12th fret and prove to yourself that the notes sound the same, only one octave higher. The thickest string played at the 12th fret is still an E, just one octave higher (the string vibrates at twice the frequency).

Finally, look at [figure 1](#fig-1) again, focusing specifically on the fight fret. Notice that the sixth string at the fifth fret is the note A, the same note as the open fifth string. Same with the D a the 5th fret of the fifth string.

It holds for all the strings except for the third and second string. Again, standard tuning makes everything shift by a fret when moving between the second and third strings.

At the 5th fret the notes are A D G C E a. Practice playing these notes at the 5th fret and saying the names out loud.

I'm not creating any tests for these, since it should only take a few minutes to memorize the notes at the fifth and 12th frets.

Please don't continue until you are 100% confident you **KNOW** these notes, however.

### 3. Notes on the sixth string

We learned in [the last post]({{< ref "/guitar/2019-02-11-just-12-notes.md" >}}) that the major scale comprises the intervals whole-step, whole-step, half-step, whole-step, whole-step, whole-step, half-step.

In other words, there is a whole step (two frets) between any two natural notes except E/F and B/C.

Since the open sixth string is the note E, this leads directly to this diagram:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/e6-string.png" caption="Notes on the E string"  >}}

Spend a few minutes just saying each natural note name out loud as you play each note, ascending up and descending down the frets. Try to do be "mindful" as you don this. The goal is to connect the note names with the fret locations in your brain and muscle memory.

Once you are comfortable just moving up and down the scale linearly, try the following GTD test:

<a name="GTD-Notes.estring"></a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="GTD-Notes.estring" details=true >}}
Work through the cycle of fourths, finding and playing each note on the sixth string. For the note E, you can either play the open string or at the 12th fret. First play B, then E, then A, etc.

First practice this rubato (out of time &mdash; don't worry about a metronome). Just take your time and try to ensure you are playing the correct note each time.

When you are comfortable with that, set your metronome to 60 BPM, and practice finding the notes of the cycle *in time* by playing half notes (two clicks per note).

Pass criteria: You can play the entire 12 note cycle of fourths in time on the E string without making any mistakes.

Extra credit: Repeat the exercise using the cycle of *fifths*.
