It's likely that the earliest form of music was made by banging two rocks together. We will discuss rhythm shortly, but even primitive musicians quickly realized that things get more interesting when you start banging different things together. [Even drummers recognize the need for different sounds/notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CqOtEz6PfA) (a drum kit has more than one thing to hit, and drumheads are even "tuned").
