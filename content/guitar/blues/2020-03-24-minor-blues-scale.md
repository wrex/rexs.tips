We [previously]({{< ref "/guitar/blues/2020-03-22-blues-scale.md" >}}) kicked off a series on learning the blues scale with a practical post on the "mother of all scale exercises".

Let's now follow up with a more theory-oriented post on the the "what" and "why" of the *minor* blues scale and it's underlying pentatonic scale.
<!--more-->

## The minor pentatonic scale

The minor blues scale is built from the minor pentatonic scale, so let's start by looking at the minor pentatonic scale in detail.

The minor pentatonic scale comprises the root, &flat;3, P4, P5, and &flat;7 scale degrees. In the key of Am, that's the notes A, C, D, E, and G.

You've probably seen this "box 1" shape for the pentatonic scale before:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-penta-box1.png" caption="Am Pentatonic, Box 1"  width="33%" >}}

Note that there is a fair bit of repetition here. The root note (in red) is repeated three times!

Instead of thinking of that shape as a scale in itself, it's better to think of it as two full octaves of the pentatonic scale repeated (technically, two full octaves plus the first two notes of a third octave).

Let's look at the first two octaves in isolation. Here's the first octave:

<a name="IFP">&nbsp;</a>
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-penta-box1-o1.png" caption="Am Pentatonic, IFP shape"  width="33%" >}}

We'll call this the "IFP" shape for "index finger pentatonic," since it's easiest to play if you start with your index finger on the root note.

Here's the other octave shape from box 1:

<a name="RFP">&nbsp;</a>
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-penta-box1-o2.png" caption="Am Pentatonic, RFP shape"  width="33%" >}}

We'll call this one the "RFP" shape for "ring finger pentatonic, since most of the notes are lower on the neck and it's easiest to play if you start with your ring finger on the root note.

It may not be immediately obvious, but those are the **only** two shapes you need to learn to play the pentatonic scale *anywhere* on the neck. (There is one small wrinkle due to the way the guitar is tuned that we will cover shortly.)

Here's the Am pentatonic scale everywhere on the neck:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-penta-15frets.png" caption="Am pentatonic, full scale"  >}}

Look for [IFP](#IFP) and [RFP](#RFP) shapes starting on *every* root note location. Note that because of the way the guitar is tuned, sometimes some of the notes shift up or down a fret when moving between strings, but the relative positioning *along* as string is always the same. This shifting is because of the way a guitar is tuned.

## Shape "morphing" due to the tuning anomaly

Each pair of strings on a guitar is tuned a perfect fourth (five semitones) apart, *except*  the 3rd and 2nd strings, which are tuned a major 3rd (four semitones) apart.

That tuning anomaly means that *any* scale, chord, or even melody shapes "morph" whenever they cross the 3rd/2nd string boundary.

A shape solely on, say, strings 3, 4, and 5 remains unaffected. Move that same shape up one string higher (strings 2, 3, and 4) such that it crosses the "morphing" boundary between strings 2 & 3, and all the notes above the boundary get shifted up a fret.

The same thing happens in reverse. Move a "morphing" shape lower such that it doesn't cross the boundary, and any notes lower than the boundary move down a fret.

{{< admonition type="tip" title="Another morphing example" details=false >}}
Play these three chords in open position slowly and in order:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/ead.png" caption="Chord Morphing"   >}}

Look closely at the three fretted notes in each shape. Notice as each shape moves over a string, the note that crosses the 3rd/2nd string boundary moves up one fret each time, and the other notes stay at the same fret.

Technically, those three chords chords contain exactly the same triad voicing with different root notes, It's called the second inversion triad, with the P5 in the bass, root in the middle, and M3 on top.

They are the same chord!

This blew my mind when it was first pointed out to me.

## Higher shape / Lower shape principle

If we move that second octave shape lower by a string so it *doesn't* cross the morphing boundary, it looks like this:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-penta-o2-Aroot.png" caption="Am pentatonic, single octave, 5th string root, lower"  width="33%" >}}

What if we'd somehow ended up with our first finger on that note instead our ring finger? Rather than moving your left hand lower three frets, you could also play the octave 1 shape at the same location:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-penta-o1-Aroot.png" caption="Am pentatonic, single octave, 5th string root, higher"  width="33%" >}}

Note that for any given root note, there are two potential ways to play the pentatonic scale starting with that note.

**This is an important concept.** For any given root note anywhere on the fretboard, you can continue a scale (or arpeggio) by moving higher up the frets on the same string, or by moving to a higher string and **down lower** on the frets.

The minor 3rd note exists three frets higher on the same string, or two frets lower on the next higher string. There are always two potential shapes starting from any given root note location.

## So why learn the blues scale first?

Okay, so if the blues scale is built on the pentatonic scale, and the pentatonic is simpler with one fewer note, why am I insisting it's better to **start** by learning the blues scale?

Here again is the **entire** Am pentatonic scale everywhere on neck:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-penta-15frets.png" caption="Am pentatonic, full scale"  >}}

As we discussed, you can either break this entire thing down into a bunch of IFP and RFP shapes starting on each of those root notes.

So what's the problem? What's wrong with learning the pentatonic scales first instead of the blues scale?

**Here's the problem**:

First, cover up the previous diagram. Now, *quickly!* Which of the dots in the following diagram are roots? Which are P5 notes?

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-penta-15frets-obfuscated.png" caption="Am pentatonic, full scale"  >}}

It's **hard**, isn't it? Every note is either a whole step or a minor third from the previous note. Everything looks the same! It's really hard to remember which note is the root, which the &flat;3, P4, P5, or &flat;7.

Now look what happens if we add just one more note, the &flat;5 between the P4 and P5:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-blues-15frets-obfuscated.png" caption="Am blues, full scale"  >}}

Quick! Find the groups of three notes in a row on adjacent frets.

That's a whole lot easier, isn't it? Those clusters of three notes in a row break up the pattern. To my brain at least, they *stand out* from the rest of the notes.

It's subtle with a diagram on a screen, but I promise you it's even more pronounced when you're physically playing notes on a fretboard. My brain uses the clusters of notes on adjacent frets to navigate.

I can't explain why, but to my brain notes that are a whole-step (two frets) or a minor third (three frets) away from each other seem random and unrelated. Two-fret or three-fret intervals all look and feel the same to me, it's hard to remember which one goes where.

I actually learned the pentatonic scale everywhere on the neck before I learned the blues scale. While I remembered the shapes and patterns of the pentatonic scale, I almost never knew what note I was playing when I used it. I had to think pretty hard to figure out if I was playing the root, M3, P4, P5 or &flat7.

Once I put memorized the entire minor blues scale all over the neck, though, I was immediately able to use the 3-note cluster locations to navigate. I started to **KNOW** the function of every note I played.

Within a cluster, I instantly, effortlessly, **KNEW** the P4 is the lower note, the &flat;5 the middle note, and the P5 the highest.

I **KNEW** the root note is always adjacent to the P4 but on a lower string, or adjacent to the P5 but on a higher string!

*That** is why I recommend learning the blues scale first. It helps you to know what you're playing. It lets you play with **intent**.

Note that navigation is easy even if only two notes are adjacent. Even two note clusters break up the pattern and stick out in my head.

Here's "box 1" of the Am blues scale (everything within reach without moving my left hand away from the 5th fret):

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-blues-15frets-box1.png" caption="Am blues, box1"  >}}

Look at the D/E&flat; cluster on the 3rd (G) string.

Sure, the E that follows is on a completely different string and miles away from the E&flat;, but I still "see" the two adjacent notes (D and E&flat;) as an anomaly in the overall pattern.

I **KNOW** the lower note in the cluster is the P4. I **KNOW** the higher note is the &flat;5. I even **KNOW** that the P5 also exists one fret higher (outside the "box") as well as where it's shown in the diagram. And I can use that knowledge to identify the rest of the notes in the scale (using "dead reckoning" to navigate from what I **KNOW**).

That ends this theory oriented post. The next post in the series will give some smaller, more focused, **practical** exercises to teach you the five positions of the blues scale, and prepare you for [TDG011]({{< ref "/guitar/blues/2020-03-22-blues-scale.md#TDG011" >}})
