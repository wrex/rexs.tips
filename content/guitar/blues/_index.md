Ah, the blues. Pretty much every musical style owes something to the blues: rock, soul, jazz, country.

I remember consciously thinking at one point:

> "I'm just a beginner, so I'll focus almost exclusively on the Blues. The blues are easy: just three chords!"

Wrong, wrong, wrong. For the record: the Blues are anything *but* easy in any sense. And I'm not just talking about technique, groove, and authenticity.

Sure the Blues comprises a "simple" three-chord I-IV-V progression, most often over a 12-bar form like this:

    I7  / %   / %  / %
    IV7 / %   / I7 / %
    V7  / IV7 / I7 / %


But *so* much else gets complicated:

* It fluidly mixes between major and minor tonality. It's common to play minor scales over major chords with the blues. In fact the major/minor interplay is almost synonymous with the sound.

* It's often extremely complex harmonically. Chord substitutions abound: secondary dominants, tritone substitutions, every trick in the book.

Ask yourself why it's a I7 and a IV7.

Normal diatonic theory would say the I and IV chords should be Maj7 chords, not Dom7. Answering "why?" is unbelievably complex. See this [blog article](http://www.ethanhein.com/wp/2014/blues-tonality/) for example (though it's way over my head). Things really get interesting when people like <a href="https://flypaper.soundfly.com/features/understanding-advanced-blues-harmony/" target="_blank">Brian Wilson or Ornette Coleman</a> get involved.

I'll try to keep things as simple as possible, but the Blues ain't easy.
