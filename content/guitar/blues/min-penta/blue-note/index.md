## The blue note

While the m3 curl isn't really an extra note, you're just tweaking the m3 a bit
sharp, we're now going to add a completely new note to the minor pentatonic
scale: the &flat;5.

The &flat;5 is known as the "blue note" and sits squarely between the tip of the
handle and the base of the pan.
