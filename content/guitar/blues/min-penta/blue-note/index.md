If you've been following along with the proficiency tests, we briefly
experimented with sounds outside the pentatonic scale by "curling" the m3, and
by sliding into one of the five pentatonic notes from a fret above or below.

One of those "outside" notes (the &flat;5) is so significant that it's earned
the name of "the blue note". Adding this note to the minor pentatonic scale
makes such a profound change that some people call this new six-note scale by
another name: _the blues scale_:

{{< figproc "blue-frying-pan" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

The &flat;5 is known as the "blue note." It sits squarely between the tip of the
handle and the base of the pan.

## Start by using it wrong

Put on an Am backing track and try playing **just** the note E&flat;. Try
different rhythms, but sound just that one note. Really hang on it.

Slowly add additional notes from the scale, but intentionally move back **to**
the &flat;5 from these new notes. In other words, _end_ your lines on the
&flat;5.

Yuck!

You probably found that exercise difficult because it sounded so bad. Most
people desperately want to move the final note in a line to _any_ other note in
the scale.

The blue note adds such a tremendous amount of tension because it sits precisely in
the middle of the scale, exactly six semitones away from the root note in either
direction. It's like balancing a see-saw: it desperately wants to fall in one
direction or the other.

## Now fix the problem

Instead of making the blue note a *destination* that you end up on and hang out
on for a while, try making it a note you move **from**. That is, move it earlier
into a phrase, perhaps off the beat, and end up on one of the pentatonic notes
nearby. In other words, use it as a passing note between other notes.

In particular, try playing the blue note, then hammering onto the P5 (again,
over an Am backing track). Ahhhh! Doesn't that sound great? It's the sound of
tension, followed by release. Try sliding _down_ from &flat;5 to P4. Try sliding
between all three notes, P4, &flat;5, P5 --- just be sure to end up anywhere but
the &flat;5! That is one of the quintessential sounds of the blues.

Fool around with bends, too. Try bending the P4 up to P5, then releasing slowly
and picking the &flat;5 on your way to P4.

Use it between other notes, too, not just the P4 and P5.

Spend some time with this one. It shouldn't be a hardship.

## Blue note for navigation

In addition to sounding great, the blue note also aids with navigation. That's
why I've decided to introduce it so early.

It was easy to keep your place when we looked at a single octave frying pan.
Each note only existed in one place:

{{< figproc "plain-frying-pan" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

But you may have noticed yourself getting a little lost occasionally when we
repeated that shape in three locations:

{{< figproc "more-pans" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

It looks straightforward enough when the shapes are highlighted on a diagram
like that, but when you're navigating the (presumably unmarked!) neck of your
own guitar it's easy to lose track of which strings have three notes and which
just two.

The difficulty is that everything looks somewhat similar: every note is a whole
step away from another note on the same string. It's _extremely_ easy to confuse
the &flat;3 and the &flat;7 at the far end of the pan, for example: was that the
C or the G?

That's why **I recommend practicing your penatonic shapes with the blue note**
as much as possible. It breaks up the pattern of whole note intervals and gives
your brain something to hang onto.

{{< figproc "blue-pans" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

The blue note provides both your muscle memory and your brain a "handle." You
know instantly, without conscious thought, that a group of three notes together
is the P4, &flat;5, and P5.

We still have several more chapters to go regarding the pentatonic scale. **All
subsequent pentatonic diagrams in this book will include the blue note**.

You don't have to _play_ the &flat;5 in your solos (that's why it's shown as an
optional triangle rather than a circle). But I strongly, **strongly** recommend
that you **always practice your pentatonic shapes with the blue note included.**

Practicing with the &flat;5 helps you keep track of which note is which.
