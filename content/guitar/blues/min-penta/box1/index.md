{{< alert title="Caution #1" color="warning" >}}
Learning to play the guitar well takes _practice_. Lots and lots and **lots** of
_practice_. Everyone tends to underestimate the degree of mastery required by
each new exercise.

You simply can't master the pentatonic (and blues) scales without putting in the
hours. The information on this page will take months (at least!) to master.

You shouldn't rush to get through each exercise introduced below, but neither should
you practice things you've already mastered. If you can already perform one exercise
(say, position one of the minor pentatonic scale) in your sleep, it's time to move on.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Caution #2" color="warning" >}} 
Before starting this lesson,
ensure you **KNOW** your minor triad shapes. In particular,
please give {{< tdgref "triads/min-top4" >}} another go to brush up. You'll use
those minor triad shapes on the top four strings through the rest of this
lesson.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Reference document available" color="info" >}}
I've created [a pdf of all the penatonic shapes]({{< resourceref "Am-pentatonic.pdf" >}}). You may find it useful to
keep a printout handy as you practice the exercises introduced below.

## Introduction

The minor pentatonic scale (and with one more note included, the blues scale) is
possibly the most generally applicable scale you'll ever learn.

{{< figproc "Am-penta-by-degree" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

You'll find yourself playing minor pentatonic licks over almost any song from
any genre. It works (with care) over songs in both minor and major keys.

For simplicity's sake we'll continue using Am pentatonic, but you should, of
course, practice in multiple keys. 

As mentioned previously, [figure 1](#Am-penta-by-degree) is too much to absorb in one swell foop.

We started by looking at just a single one-octave shape: the frying pan. The
frying pan shape helped us learn about a third of the diagram above. Now it's
time to fill in the remaining gaps.

There are several other ways of breaking [figure 1](#Am-penta-by-degree) into more tractable chunks.
The most common is to break it into five "boxes" or "positions." Each "box"
contains notes reachable without moving your hand (much).

You've probably seen something similar to the following diagram before. It's
commonly referred to as "box 1," "position 1," or the "root position" of the Am
Pentatonic scale. 

{{< figproc "root" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

{{< alert title="Visual complexity" color="info" >}}
I realize that annotating the diagrams with chord shapes and blue notes 
makes it more complex visually, but trust me, the additional
complexity is worth it.

Chord shapes and the three-note groupings with the blue note provide important
aids to recalling the scale from memory, navigating around the fretboard, and
knowing which note is which. {{< /alert >}}

We'll look at the remaining boxes in subsequent chapters of this course.

## Chord shape "hooks"

Notice that I've highlighted a familiar minor triad shape on the top four strings
(the notes outlined with another circle). We'll use these chord shapes to help
us navigate. They give us a "handle" to recall the scale fragment from memory,
and they should help us find the root notes.

For example: Let's say I knew I wanted to solo over Dm. If my hand was already
somewhere around the tenth fret, I'd "see" the Dm triad shape at the tenth fret
in my mind's eye (the same shape as in [Fig. 2](#root)). Then I'd just hang the remaining
notes of the scale (that I've already memorized) around that shape. The triad
shape is the "handle" or "hook" into my memory to recall the full shape.

Of course, for this to work, you must already **KNOW** your minor triads on the
top four strings. That's why it's important to practice {{< tdgref "triads/min-top4" >}}
until you know your minor chord shapes on the top four strings in your sleep.

## Above and below

The frying pan isn't the only one-octave shape. Let's look at two more.

As should be obvious, [figure two](#root) is a multi-octave scale fragment. If
you were to play it in order from the root on the thickest string to the
&flat;3 on the thinnest, you would play two complete octaves and a bit of a
third. 

Start with any root note anywhere on the neck: there's a &flat;3 either
three frets higher on the _same_ string, or two frets lower on the _next_ string
(remember the fret shift when moving between string 3 and string 2). **There are
always two options, moving up the neck, or moving down the neck (and over a
string).**

{{< figproc "first-octave" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

The diagram above is a "below" shape.

You'd normally start playing the shape above with your first finger on the root
note. The remaining notes are on the same or higher frets. You can reach any of
them easily without moving your hand position.

That's an "above" shape.

{{< figproc "second-octave" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

The figure above is a "below" shape.

{{< alert title="Familiar?" color="warning" >}}
As an aside, can you see how the shape above is just the familiar frying pan
with some of the notes moved an octave?
{{< /alert >}}

You'd normally start with your third finger on the root. The remaining notes are
(mostly) at the same fret or _lower_ on the neck. Again, you can reach the
remaining notes without moving your hand.

You can use this "above/below" concept to great advantage: _any_ root note you
might want to play around next must be close to either your index finger or your
third-finger/pinky. It _has_ to be close to one or the other.

Since your hand already spans four frets, you shouldnâ€™t need to move your
left hand very far no matter what the next root note might be.

Watch the pros and notice how efficiently they move their hands. Their
hands always seem to be in the right place for the notes they want to play.
Their ability to choose shapes that hang higher or lower relative to a nearby
target is what allows this efficiency.

{{< tdgalert "min-penta/boxes" >}}
This is the master proficiency test for all the "boxes" in the minor pentatonic
scale. Attempt this after learning all the shapes individually, as well as after
learning to connect them in groups of three.

{{< tdgalert "min-penta/boxes/box1" >}}
This is the drill to get "box 1" under your fingers.
