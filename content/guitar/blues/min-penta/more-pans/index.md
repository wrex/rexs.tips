By now you should have realized that we can use [octave shapes]({{< ref "guitar/fundamentals/notes/finding-notes#octave-shapes" >}}) to move that frying pan shape anywhere we want.

Let's create two clones of our frying pan, one an octave lower and another an octave higher:

{{< figproc "more-pans" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

Simply shift the licks you've already created to these new locations to add some dynamism and energy to your solos.

Start low and slow, for example, then move toward a climax where you start wailing with loud and fast trills in the highest pan. Listen again to familiar rock or blues solos for inspiration.

Even better, these shapes *connect* to one another. Instead of treating them as three disjoint shapes, create lines that fluidly move between them.

Best of all, it takes very little mental effort to **KNOW** *a priori* which note you're playing. Instead of thinking about a single shape with different pitches, you should be thinking about five *notes*.

Do you see how the "heel" of the original pan (the root note A) butts up to the handle of the lower pan shape? The handle of the original shape (E) also butts up to the heel of the higher pan, except the tuning anomaly moves everything up a fret.

If you had more strings, the pattern would continue diagonally like that indefinitely, both higher and lower.

### Practice drills

The first few drills aren't worth a complete proficiency test.

First, simply practice each "pan" in position, individually. Just get your fingers used to finding the same five notes in a different location.

Then try connecting the lower two pans. Do an ascending run from the G on the sixth string to the E on the third string, then descend back down. Play with these ten pitches (five notes in two different octaves) until you're comfortable. The goal is to "see" both pans on the fretboard without effort.

Make **certain** you know which note you are playing at all times! End your phrases on A as usual, but you should find it liberating to have more than one to play with.

Then repeat with the higher two pans.

The best soloists play **confidently** and with **intent**. Try hard to aim for specific notes even as you move between pans. Know what you're aiming for *before you play it*.

If it any point you aren't completely confident how a note will sound *before* you play it, **stop** and reduce the number of "pans."

Of course, you should also experiment a bit. If you stumble across something that sounds good, stop and analyze what you just played. Play it again. Write it down in your journal! Remember it for next time.

Once you've connected the upper and lower pairs, practice playing with all three at once.

{{< alert color="success" title="TDG0005e â€¢ Connection drills" >}}
[TDG0005f]({{< ref "guitar/tests/blues/pan-connection-drills" >}}) provides some mechanical drills to help you cement the locations for all these pitches into your brain.

Pattern drills like these force you to visualize the shapes on the fretboard. They also help to improve technique, and prevent you from playing the same old licks and ascending/descending runs over and over.

Remember: you play what you practice.

Once you've mastered all three pan shapes, attempt [TDG0005e]({{< ref "guitar/tests/blues/one-note" >}}) again, but this time use all fifteen pitches.

Experiment. Have fun.
