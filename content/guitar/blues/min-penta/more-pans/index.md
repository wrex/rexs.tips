By now you should have realized that we can use [octave shapes]({{< ref
"guitar/fundamentals/notes/finding-notes#octave-shapes" >}}) to move that frying
pan shape anywhere we want.

Let's create two clones of our frying pan, one an octave lower and another an octave higher:

{{< figproc "more-pans" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

Simply shift the licks you've already created to these new locations to add some dynamism and energy to your solos.

Start low and slow, for example, then move toward a climax where you start wailing with loud and fast trills in the highest pan. Listen again to familiar rock or blues solos for inspiration.

Even better, these shapes *connect* to one another. Instead of treating them as three disjoint shapes, create lines that fluidly move between them.

Best of all, it takes very little mental effort to **KNOW** *a priori* which note you're playing. Instead of thinking about a single shape with different pitches, you should be thinking about five *notes*.

Do you see how the "heel" of the original pan (the root note A) butts up to the handle of the lower pan shape? The handle of the original shape (E) also butts up to the heel of the higher pan, except the tuning anomaly moves everything up a fret.

If you had more strings, the pattern would continue diagonally like that indefinitely, both higher and lower.

### Practice drills

The first few drills aren't worth a complete proficiency test.

First, simply practice each "pan" in position, individually. Just get your fingers used to finding the same five notes in a different location.

Then try connecting the lower two pans. Do an ascending run from the G on the sixth string to the E on the third string, then descend back down. Play with these ten pitches (five notes in two different octaves) until you're comfortable. The goal is to "see" both pans on the fretboard without effort.

Make **certain** you know which note you are playing at all times! End your phrases on A as usual, but you should find it liberating to have more than one to play with.

Then repeat with the higher two pans.

The best soloists play **confidently** and with **intent**. Try hard to aim for specific notes even as you move between pans. Know what you're aiming for *before you play it*.

If it any point you aren't completely confident how a note will sound *before* you play it, **stop** and reduce the number of "pans."

Of course, you should also experiment a bit. If you stumble across something that sounds good, stop and analyze what you just played. Play it again. Write it down in your journal! Remember it for next time.

Once you've connected the upper and lower pairs, practice playing with all three at once.

This proficiency test provides some mechanical drills to help you cement the
locations for all these pitches into your brain.

Pattern drills like these force you to visualize the shapes on the fretboard.
They also help to improve technique, and prevent you from playing the same old
licks and ascending/descending runs over and over.

Remember: you play what you practice.

## The sound of each note

Please take a moment to repeat {{< tdgref "blues/one-note" >}}: _slowly_ play some lines (short
sequences of two to seven or so notes from the Am pentatonic scale) over a
single chord vamp (Am, or Am7). You'll probably want to end the majority of your
lines on the note A, but experiment by ending on different notes as well.

Develop a visceral feel for all the notes in the scale. Practice until
you know how a note will sound _before_ you play it.

To me, the notes sound as follows:

Root (A) 
: This is by far the most consonant sound. It feels like home. It
sounds **good**, sweet, complete. Pure sugar. 

&flat;3 (C) 
: C evokes longing, or sadness. It fits over any Am chord (Am, Am7, Am9, Am13). It definitely belongs,
but it emphasizes that minor/sad/savory quality. It reminds me of a sweet onion.

P4 (D) 
: D sounds slightly uncomfortable over an Am. The longer you hang on it,
the more uncomfortable listeners become. It's not _wrong_, exactly, but it feels like it wants to go
somewhere else. Like thyme, it's really great in moderation.

P5 (E) 
: E sounds almost as resonant as A. Not quite "home", but it's at least the
front porch. It's like adding MSG to the flavor of the root note: it makes it meatier.

&flat;7 (G) 
: G Am sounds "cool" or "jazzy" to me. If the band is playing Am
triads in the background, then G gives it that cool, jazzy, minor-seventh vibe.
Technically, you **are** playing an Am7 when you play the G note over an Am
triad! (Am7 comprises the notes A, C, E, and **G**). It's like cinnamon -- goes
great with almost anything.

In summary, over Am, the only note you need to be careful with is D (the P4),
everything else is just compatible spices. They all sound a little different,
but they all work. You probably don't want to hang on a D too long. Unless you
do! Sometimes a song **wants** that extra tension.

Note that these sounds/feelings/tastes change **every time the underlying chord
changes**. So far, we've only explored the sound over a single chord: the i7
(I minor seventh) chord. The scale note sounds will change as the chords change.

The &flat;3, for example, will sound _very_ different over a I7. The half step
difference between the &flat;3 from the scale and the M3 in the chord tends to grate
on the ears! As we practiced, simply "curling" or "tweaking" that C a bit
toward the major 3rd relieves _much_ of that tension.

A song in the key of Am might contain the chords Am7, Dm7, Em7 and
E7. All five notes in the Am pentatonic scale will _work_ over any of these chords
since they are all in the **key** of Am, but the sound/feeling/taste **changes**
as the underlying chord change. That D note, for example, will sound sweet as
sugar when the chord changes to Dm, for example.

Anticipating chord changes is the hardest part of soloing! 

The best solos play _just_ the right note at the _exact instant_ the underlying
chord changes. This is incredibly difficult at first, but, as always, gets
easier with practice.

Practice first with one chord vamps (e.g. Am7) as long asnecessary. Only when
you're _completely_ comfortable should progress to the remaining drills linked to below.

## Learning to solo

Learning to solo over a complete 12-bar blues is **hard**. It takes hours and
hours and hours and **hours** of practice. 

As always, it's best to break that practice into small, bite-sized chunks.

First recognize that **most blues songs use Major chords**! 

A "standard" 12-bar blues often has the following chords:

    I7  / %   / %  / %
    IV7 / %   / I7 / %
    V7  / IV7 / I7 / V7

Those dominant-7th chords are all _Major_.

Minor blues progressions are much more varied, but a typical progression might
look like:

    i7  / %   / %  / %
    iv7 / %   / i7 / %
    v7  / iv7 / i7 / V7

Those are all minor chords, except for the V7 in the last bar.

While the minor pentatonic scale definitely works over a major blues, I
recommend starting with minor chords for your backing tracks.

I believe it's best to _first_ learn the sounds of a minor scale over minor
chords. When you curl the m3 over i7, you're _adding_ tension (as opposed to
releasing tension over a I7). It takes time to develop a feel for when and how
to bend or curl notes. I find it easiest if most of the scale notes work "out of
the box," without adding any bends or curls.

So first get comfortable playing over just the i chord with {{< tdgref
"blues/one-note" >}}.

When you are ready, proceed to the following exercises, but take your time.

I'm always in too much of a rush to move on to new exercises. It's easy to
underestimate the _degree_ of mastery required with each exercise. Keep at it
until you can't stand it any longer, and only then move to the next exercise.
