Scales contain only a few notes, but every note appears in **many** locations on the fretboard, so even a scale with only five notes [meanders all over the fretboard]({{< ref "guitar/blues/min-penta#Am-wholeneck" >}}).

I can play the note E in *thirteen* distinct locations in five different octaves on my favorite guitar!

This is why we tend to think about *shapes* when memorizing scales and chords. Shapes help our tiny pea brains to remember where to find the notes.

Please realize, though, that each note evokes a single mood/feeling/color/taste over a given chord or chord progression. This is true no matter which octave of the note you play. An E sounds like an E sound, even if one is double the pitch of the other.

Solos generate excitement and interest as they ascend or descend into different octaves, but the *function* and feeling/color/taste of each note within each octave stays the same. Apples come in all different shapes, sizes, and flavors, but they never taste like bananas.

### Five *tones*

Am pentatonic is the five notes A, C, D, E, and G. PERIOD.

Each of these notes evokes a certain feeling over a Blues in &laquo;A Major&raquo; and a slightly different feeling over &laquo;A minor&raquo;.

Let's first focus on just one location for each of those five notes:

{{< figproc "frying-pan" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

The shape resembles a frying pan (with the E a the end of the handle).

The note A obviously sounds great over A7: it's the root of the underlying chord. If you play any other note over A7, it won't sound quite as [consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance).

E sounds almost as consonant, but different somehow. E over AMaj adds a bit of ... salty-sweetness (it sounds slightly Celtic to my ears). The remaining notes have different qualities.

In order to create great sounds, whether an off-the-cuff solo or a pre-composed melody, you must *viscerally* learn how notes sound over different chords. You must **KNOW** how it will sound *before* you play it!

### Playing with *intent*

No written description can possibly teach sounds. Everyone has to learn for themselves how notes sound in different contexts, by *practicing on their guitar*.

As obvious as this seems: **unless you KNOW what note you're playing, you'll never learn to anticipate how it will sound**.

The sound of each note depends on *context*. In particular, the notes of the minor pentatonic scale sound different over a minor chord than they do over a major chord. Not better or worse, just different.

We still aren't creating complete sentences or stories with this exercise, as in a real solo, because we've intentionally limited ourselves to just the five specific notes in a single octave over a single chord. Over the course of this chapter, we'll start adding other colors to the palette and learn how to play over an entire progression, not just a single chord.

That feeling of power from this exercise comes from playing with **intent**. You are producing the sounds *you* want to make, not some canned lick you pulled off the internet.

Have fun!
