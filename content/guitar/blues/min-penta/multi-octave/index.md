{{< alert title="Caution #1" color="warning" >}}
Learning to play the guitar well takes _practice_. Lots and lots and **lots** of
_practice_. Everyone tends to underestimate the degree of mastery required by
each new exercise.

You simply can't master the pentatonic (and blues) scales without putting in the
hours. The information on this page will take months (at least!) to master.

You shouldn't rush to get through each exercise introduced below, but neither should
you practice things you've already mastered. If you can already perform one exercise
(say, position one of the minor pentatonic scale) in your sleep, it's time to move on.

{{< alert title="Caution #2" color="warning" >}} 
Before starting this lesson,
ensure you **KNOW** your minor triad shapes. In particular,
please give {{< tdgref "triads/min-top4" >}} another go to brush up. You'll use
those minor triad shapes on the top four strings through the rest of this
lesson.

I've created [a pdf of all the penatonic shapes]({{< resourceref "Am-pentatonic.pdf" >}}). You may find it useful to
keep a printout handy as you practice the exercises introduced below.

## Introduction

The frying pan shape helped us find about a third of the minor pentatonic notes on the
neck. Now it's time to fill in the remaining gaps.

For simplicity's sake, we'll continue using Am pentatonic, but you should, of
course, practice in multiple keys. For reference, here is Am pentatonic all over
the neck (without the blue note):

{{< figproc "Am-penta-by-degree" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

The most common way of breaking this down into more tractable chunks, is to break
it into five "boxes" or "positions" where you can play notes without moving your
hand (much).

You've probably seen something similar to the following diagram before. It's
commonly referred to as "box 1," "position 1," or the "root position" of the Am
Pentatonic scale. 

{{< figproc "root" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

{{< alert title="Visual complexity" color="info" >}}
I realize that annotating the diagrams with chord shapes and blue notes 
makes it more complex visually, but I feel strongly that both are critical. They
provide important aids to recalling the scale from memory, navigating around the
fretboard, and knowing which note is which.
{{< /alert >}}


We'll look at the remaining boxes in subsequent chapters of this course.

First, notice that I've highlighted a familiar minor triad shape on the top four strings
(the notes outlined with another circle). We'll use these chord shapes to help
us navigate. They give us a "handle" to recall the scale fragment from memory,
and they should help us find the root notes.

Let's say I knew I wanted to solo over Dm. If my hand was already somewhere
around the tenth fret, I'd "see" that Dm triad shape at the tenth fret in my
mind's eye (the same shape as in Fig. 2). Then I'd just hang the remaining notes
of the scale (that I've already memorized) around that shape. The triad shape is
the "handle" or "hook" into my memory to recall the full shape.

Of course, for this to work, you must already **KNOW** your minor triads on the
top four strings. That's why I had you practice {{< tdgref "triads/min-top4" >}}
until you could recall any minor triad instantantly and effortlessly.

Next, recognize that _figure two is a multi-octave scale fragment_. If you were to
play it in order from the root on the thickest string, you would play two
complete octaves and a bit of a third. 

Multi-octave scale fragments are, of course, comprised of multiple single-octave
shapes. We've been using the "frying pan" as one such single-octave shape, but
there are others.

## Above and below

Refering to [Fig 1.](#Am-penta-by-degre), notice that no matter which root note we start
on, we can find a &flat;3 either three frets higher on the _same_ string, or two frets
lower on the _next_ string (remember the fret shift when moving between string 3
and string 2). There are always two options, moving up the neck, or
moving down the neck (and over a string).

{{< figproc "first-octave" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

You'd normally play that the first octave shown above starting with your
first finger on the root note. The remaining notes are on the same or higher
frets, and can be reached easily without moving your hand position.

{{< figproc "second-octave" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

You'd normally start the second octave with your third finger on the root. The
remaining notes are at (mostly) the same fret or _lower_ on the neck. Again, you
can reach the remaining notes without moving your hand.

You can use this "above/below" concept to great advantage: _any_ root note you
might want to play around next must be close to either your index finger or your
pinky. It _has_ to be close to one or the other.

Since your hand already spans four frets, you shouldnâ€™t need to move your
left hand very far no matter what the next root note might be.

Watch the pros and notice how efficiently they move their hands. Their
hands always seem to be in the right place for the notes they want to play.
Their ability to choose shapes that hang higher or lower relative to a nearby
target is what allows this efficiency.
