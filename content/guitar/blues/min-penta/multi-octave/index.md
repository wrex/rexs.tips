{{< alert title="Caution" color="warning" >}}
Learning to play the guitar well takes _practice_. Lots and lots and **lots** of
_practice_. Everyone tends to underestimate the degree of mastery required by
each new exercise.

You simply can't master the pentatonic (and blues) scales without putting in the
hours. The information on this page will take months (at least!) to master.

You shouldn't rush to get through each exercise introduced below, but neither should
you practice things you've already mastered. If you can already perform one exercise
(say, position one of the minor pentatonic scale) in your sleep, it's time to move on.
{{< /alert >}}

Before starting this lesson, ensure you **KNOW** your minor triad shapes. In
particular, please give {{< tdgref "triads/min-top4" >}} another go to brush up.
You'll use those minor triad shapes on the top four strings through the rest of
this lesson.

The frying pan shape helped us find our way around about a third of the minor
pentatonic notes on the neck. Now it's time to fill in the remaining locations.

For simplicity's sake, we'll continue using Am pentatonic, but you should, of
course, practice in multiple keys.
