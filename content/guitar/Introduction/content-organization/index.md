There are two different types of content in the guitar portion of this site:

* *Documentation pages* explain theory and practical lessons/tutorials to assist in learning.

* *Proficiency tests* are practical *exercises* with objective criteria to let you know when you've mastered the exercise.

Basically, read most of these pages like a book, but when you're ready to start practicing, head over to [proficiency tests]({{< ref "/guitar/tests" >}}) and follow the instructions.

Proficiency tests are the result of what I'm calling [Test Driven Guitar]({{< ref "/guitar/Introduction/test-driven-guitar" >}}). Feel free to skip that chapter if you just want to get on with learning the instrument.
