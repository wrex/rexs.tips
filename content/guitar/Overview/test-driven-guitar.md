One of my weaknesses is that I'm constantly distracted by all the great material available on the internet. I'll see a new YouTube video, or stumble acroass a website with some fantastic new song/technique/whatever.

I become so interested that I drop whatever I was practicing previously, and start diving into this new material.

Then I stumble upon yet another great site or video. Maybe it's even a better take on something I was already studying or practicing. So I drop what I was doing and work on the next thing.

I get bored or frustrated with that, so I start working ahead with other content from the same source.

Then I'm distracted again with yet another video or website, and the cycle repeats!

Before long, I'm hopefully confused. I can't remember what I was working on previously, so I just doodle around or practice the pentatonic scale some more.
