I don't know about you, but I'm constantly distracted by all the great material available on the internet. I'll see a new YouTube video, or stumble acroass a website with some fantastic new song/technique/whatever.

I frequently become so interested in something that I drop whatever I was practicing, and start diving into the new material.

Then I stumble upon yet another great site or video &mdash; maybe an even better take on something that I was already studying. So I drop what I was doing and work on the next thing.

I eventually get bored or frustrated with that, so I start working ahead with other content from the same source.

Then I'm distracted again with yet another video or website, and the cycle repeats ad nauseum!

Before long, I'm hopefully confused. I can't remember what I was working on before the latest shiny object, so I just doodle around or practice things I've already mastered.

### Tracking practice items

I needed a way to keep track of what I was working on. Conceptually, I wanted a list of "things to practice" that kept track of my progress and kept me from getting lost.

I definitely *didn't* want anything that dictated a rigid, linear progression through the items, though. Most instructional sites are written that way: complete this, then do that, and only then start this new thing.

Somedays I just didn't feel like working on technique and wanted to better undertand theory. Other days I *only* wanted to focus on technique. Still other days, I just wanted to practice actually making music (playing a song, switching between chords, or picking out a melody).

My energy level and inclinations *change* day by day. This is normal (or at least so I've convinced myself).

One thing I know for sure is that learning is **not** linear!

It's completely reasonable and normal (unavoidable in fact) to branch out and explore whatever strikes your fancy on any given day, **but** it's vital that you keep track of your progress and remain sufficiently disciplined to work on the things that *still need work*.

I needed a way to simply list all of the practice items and track my progress with them.

For each item, I wanted to quickly know both the topic (perhaps just a title) as well as my current progress.

To track progress, I really only need to know each item's *state*. Was it:

* Never attempted? (I might want to attempt it someday, but so far I've never tried.)

* In progress? (I've practiced the item at least once. Ideally, it would be nice to know the date of my last attempt as well as how many times I've tried it previously.)

* Mastered? (I've mastered the item sufficiently that it's probably better to spend my limited practice time on other items.)

### Defining "done"

That last item above raises an interesting point. How do you know when you've practiced something sufficiently to consider it mastered?

I decided to borrow a technique from software developers called "test driven development" or TDD.

With TDD, you write tests *first*, and only then begin coding the actual software implementation.

The process follows a cycle:

1. **Red Light**. The tests are written, but fail (with a "red" message) because the code is just a "stub" that doesn't actually do anything.

2. **Green Light**. The developer codes the simplest possible implementation that makes the test pass ("green" light). The code is usually pretty ugly and slow at this point.

3. **Refactor**. The developer then makes changes to the code ("refactoring") to make it more readable, maintanable, efficient, and fast, rerunning the test periodically to ensure the code still works. After each change is tested, the code is broken unless the light is green.

While the field of software development is obviously quite different from playing guitar, I think there are some ideas from TDD that we can apply. I call this "test driven guitar".

The most important idea is to **explicitly define what makes the light turn green**. In other words, document precisely what it takes to know you've practiced enough.

### TDG in practice

I'm calling each item in TDG a "proficiency test". Each item explicitly states what constitutes basic proficency for the item (a "green" light).

The criteria often involves a metronome: e.g. "You can complete the exercise three times in a row with half notes at 120 BPM without error". The metronome is not just for developing your sense of time, it's also an incredibly disciplined task master.

Imagine teaching a child to recite the alphabet.

My father used to tell a great story about teasing his younger brother: "You're so dumb I bet you can't even recite the alphabet." My uncle replied, "Sure I can! ... Of course, once you get up to 'R' and all that stuff ....".

I bet my uncle could repeat the alphabet at 40 BPM quarter notes, but he'd probably have struggled at a faster tempo.

Other times, unfortunately, the criteria might be unavoidbly subjective and will require self assesment: "You can play the lick/song/whatever fluently and expressively without undue stress."
