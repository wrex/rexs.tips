  Why learn guitar from someone who can't even play terribly well?
---

This site attempts to teach anyone how to play guitar. The author has a decent grasp of fundamental music theory, can play well enough to occasionally make somewhat musical sounding noises, and thoroughly enjoys teaching. But I'm not going to be signing any recording contracts any time soon.

So why do I bother with this content?

I'm convinced that beginners sometimes make better teachers than experts. Experts often *forget* what it was like to be completely lost. They sometimes assume context and skills that students simply lack.

Many expert players simply aren't good teachers. I've heard great players trying to teach get frustrated and say something along the lines of: "Just freaking *play*, man!".

That said, there are *many* truly phenomenal guitar instruction sites already out there on the web (some free and some paid).

I can heartily recommend any of the following:

[JustinGuitar](https://justinguitar.com)
: This is the gold standard in guitar instruction. If you're an absolute beginner at guitar, I strongly, **strongly**, encourage you to start here first. The amount and quality of **free** instruction here is incredible.

[FretboardOS](https://fretboardanatomy.com)
: (Also known as [GuitarOS](https://www.guitaros.com) &mdash; I'm not sure which is preferred.) "Josh Frets" was by far my most influential teacher so far. I consider his "Metronome Bootcamp" (FREE) to be essential content for any player, and the style and thoroughness of his remaining (paid) content was what allowed me to progress faster than ever before.

[GypsyAndJazz](https://www.gypsyandjazz.com)
: I have a real passion for the Gypsy Jazz style. Django really created something great back in the war years. I love listening to modern virtuosos like Joshco, Birelli, Stochello and the rest. Yaakov is a gifted instructor &mdash; I'm still confident I'll eventually be able to play at least half as well as him!

[AbsoluteBluesGuitar](http://absolutebluesguitar.com)
: I'm also passionate about the blues. It's at the heart of so many different styles of music. Bobby Harrison is a gifted player and provides some great, reasonably priced content starting at an extremely basic level.

[TrueFire](https://truefire.com)
: This site is a treasure trove for huge numbers of gifted instructors and amazing content in absolutely any style. Recommended.


### Why this site?

To be completely honest, you will probably be better served by one of the sites I've listed above.

Here are a few reasons you might want to stick around, though:

* **This site is written by an engineer for engineers**. Tech nerds represent! I know how we think, and how deeply we need to understand "why". I also know how easy it is for us to get distracted and miss the important stuff. Almost all of this content was written expressly for one of my closest friends (and currently the only user of the site!).

* **It's written by a beginner for beginners**. Though I've been struggling with the instrument for decades, at best I'm an intermediate player. I still have epiphanies every few days. I try to get recent breakthroughs in understanding and tricks for practicing technique onto the site while they are still fresh in my mind.

* **It's prescriptive about what to practice**. Like many, my practice sessions are often a disorganized and inefficient mess. I have to think too hard about "what should I be practicing". On this site, I'm trying out an idea about "test driven guitar". A long sequence of drills and proficiency tests to choose from. Eventually I hope to provide a mechanism for tracking which tests have been attempted (and when) and which have been mastered, but even tracking with pencil and paper is proving useful.

### Where should I go next?

If I haven't scared you off, you should probably start with one of the following

* [Getting Started](#TODO): How to start learning.
