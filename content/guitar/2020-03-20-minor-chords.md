What's sweet without savoury? Light without dark? Happy without sad?

Moving one note in a chord has a *profound* effect. Let's investigate the sadder side of harmony.

We will discuss triads (three note chords) in depth in other posts on this site, but here is a bare bones introduction.

Triads are built out of intervals. Specifically, they are built out of intervals of *a third*.

There are two types of third intervals: minor and major thirds. A minor third is three found three semitones (three frets) higher than a reference note. A major third is found four semitones higher.

That half-step difference affects the sound of the chord **profoundly**.
