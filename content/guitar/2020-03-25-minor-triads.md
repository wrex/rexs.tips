Triads (three note chords) are the most fundamental building block for harmony. This is a practical post on how to learn and play minor triads on the top four strings anywhere on the neck.
<!--more-->

Here is the TDG proficiency test for minor triads on the top three strings:

<a name="TDG012">&nbsp;</a>
{{< admonition type="success" title="TDG012 â€¢ 4-string Minor Triads" details=true >}}
This exercise should be performed with half notes at 60 BPM (or higher).

Progress through the cycle of 4ths. Play all three minor triad shapes along the neck for each root note. Start at the lowest position on the neck as possible, and continue as high as you can comfortably reach.

Start with the root note B. The lowest B on the top four strings is the open B string, but it's not possible to play 2nd inversion Bm with that note (because it requires notes below the nut). So the lowest playable Bm uses the B at the 4th fret of the G string (root inversion).

Play the root inversion Bm, 1st inversion, and 2nd inversion at least. If you can comfortably reach, repeat the root inversion Bm with the B at the 16th fret.

Next play the 1st inversion Em using the top three open strings. Then the 2nd inversion, root inversion, and 1st inversion again using the top strings at the 12th fret.

Continue through all 12 notes in the cycle of 4ths.

Pass criteria: You can complete the entire cycle of fourths in time and without any flubbed notes.

A minor triad contains three notes: the root, m3, and P5 scale degrees. Cm, for example, is built from the notes C, E&flat;, and G. You can also think of this as two stacked thirds: C to E&flat; is an interval of a minor 3rd, and E&flat; to G is an interval of a major third.

If we limit ourselves to the top three strings on the neck, there are three ways to form a minor triad:

<a name="fig1">&nbsp;</a>
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/C-minor-Inversions.png" caption="Fig 1. C Minor Triads on the Top Three Strings"  >}}

Starting from the left we have a root inversion triad (R, &flat;3, P5), 1st inversion (&flat;3, P5, R), and 2nd inversion (P5, R, &flat;3).

Each inversion is found by raising each note to the next note in the triad along the same string. Moving from the root inversion to the 1st inversion, C is raised to E&flat;, E&flat; is raised to G, and G is raised to C. The same thing happens from 1st to 2nd inversion, and from 2nd inversion back to the root inversion.

Memorize these shapes and pay particular note to the location of the root within each shape. Practice playing and moving between the shapes, first "seeing" the root location, and forming the rest of the triad around it.

Now practice finding and playing other minor triads.
