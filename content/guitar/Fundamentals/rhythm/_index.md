For the moment, please work through the following *free* two week course from Josh Frets: [Metronome Bootcamp](https://learn.guitaros.com/p/metronome-boot-camp/).

Josh's bootcamp provides an incredibly thorough introduction to improving your time feel with a metronome. The whole course is incredible, but I strongly recommend paying particular attention to MBC lessons eight to eleven (putting the click on beats two and four).

I highly, highly recommend the remainder of Josh's courses as well. They helped me tremendously.
