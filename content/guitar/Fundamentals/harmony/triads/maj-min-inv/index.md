The C Major triad comprises the notes C, E, and G (skipping the intervening notes: D and F). It's a minor 3rd interval stacked on top of a major 3rd. The M3 interval between C and E is what gives the chord its "happy" sound.

#### C Major: C E G

C
: root note of the chord.

E
: M3 of the chord, a Major 3rd from C.

G
: P5 of the chord, a minor 3rd above E, a perfect fifth from C.

The C minor triad comprises the notes C, E&flat;, and G. The minor 3rd between the first two notes is what gives it the "sad" or "poignant" quality.

#### C minor: C E&flat; G

C
: root note of the chord.

E&flat;
: m3 of the chord, a minor 3rd from C.

G
: P5 of the chord, a Major 3rd above E&flat;, a perfect fifth from C.

Here is one way to play the C Major and C minor triads on the top three strings:

{{< figproc "c-major-GBE-root" "Resize" "200x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

{{< figproc "c-minor-GBE-root" "Resize" "200x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}


As you can see, simply moving the 3rd (the middle note) down a fret changes the quality of the chord from major to minor.

When the notes are in order like this (ordered root, 3rd, 5th from lowest pitch to highest) we call the form of the triad the "root voicing" or "root inversion".

### Voicings / Inversions

There are other orderings of the three notes besides the root inversion, of course. The six possible permutations of the three notes in Cmaj are:

* Close voicing:
  * C E G  (root inversion, with the root in the bass)
  * E G C  (1st inversion, with the 3rd in the bass)
  * G C E  (2nd inversion, with the 5th in the bass)
* Spread voicings:
  * C G E (2nd inversion with the root dropped an octave)
  * E C G (root inversion with the M3 dropped an octave)
  * G E C (1st inversion with the P5 dropped an octave)


The first three of these groupings are called "close voicings" because the notes are as close together as possible. They can be played on adjacent strings, and are *by far* the more important ones to know.

The others are called "spread voicings" or "drop chord voicings" because one of the notes (voices) is lowered an octave. They can sound beautiful and are worth studying, but they can only be played if you skip a string (easiest with finger-style guitar).

**We will ignore spread voicings for the remainder of these pages**. Spread voicings are a more advanced topic that you might want to explore on your own.

### C Major inversions

On the top three strings of the guitar, the three close voicings of the C Major triad are played as follows:

{{< figproc "C-Major-Inversions.png" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

Notice that when moving up the neck to the next inversion, each "voice" in the triad (lowest, middle, or highest pitch) moves up to the next higher note.

When moving from the root inversion to the 1st inversion, the C (root) on the 3rd string moves to E (M3), E moves to G (p5), and G moves to C (root). CEG &rarr; EGC.

The same thing occurs going from first to second inversion: EGC &rarr; GCE. And again when repeating the next higher root inversion (at frets 15-17 if you can reach): GCE &rarr; CEG.

These three shapes allow you to play **any** major chord! If you move any of these three shapes two frets higher, it forms D Major (the notes D, F&sharp;, and A).

**It's very important to remember where the root note is** in each of these shapes!

You'll often find yourself thinking only about the root notes of each new chord in a song or progression. You'll then find the closest location for that note and form the rest of the shape around it.

If you want to play G major, for example, you can choose between the G at the 12th fret 3rd string, 8th fret of the B string, or 3rd fret of the E string. It's then just a matter of forming the correct shape around that root note. It gets easier with practice!
