The C Major triad comprises the notes C, E, and G (skipping the intervening notes: **C** *d* **E** *f* **G**). It's a minor 3rd stacked on top of a major 3rd. The M3 interval between C and E is what gives the chord its "happy" sound.

The C minor triad comprises the notes C, E&flat;, and G. This time the minor 3rd between the first two notes is what gives it the "sad" or "poignant" quality.

Here is how to play the C Major and C minor triads on the top three strings:

{{< figproc "c-minor-GBE-root" "Resize" "200x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}


As you can see, simply moving the 3rd (the middle note) down a half step changes the quality of the chord from major to minor.

When the notes are in order like this (ordered root, 3rd, 5th from lowest pitch to highest) we call the form of the triad the "root position" or "root inversion".

There are other orderings of the three notes besides the root inversion, of course. The six permutations of the three notes in the C Major triad are: CEG, EGC, GCE, CGE, ECG, and GEC.

The first three of these groupings are called "close voicings" because the notes are as close together as possible. The others are called "spread voicings" or "drop chord voicings" because one of the notes (voices) is moved to a different octave and is no longer as close as possible to the others.

ECG is a spread voicing, for example, because there is another G in between E and C that is skipped over (the G in the chord is in a higher octave than the E). The E that was previously between the C and G in root position was "dropped" an octave. On the fretboard, you can only play a spread voicing by skipping at least one string. Only close voicings are playable on three adjacent strings.

We will limit ourselves to close voicings for the remainder of these pages. Spread voicings are a more advanced topic that you should explore on your own.

The three close voicings for C Major are:

* CEG (root inversion, with the root in the bass)

* EGC (1st inversion, with the 3rd in the bass)

* GCE (2nd inversion, with the 5th in the bass)

On the top three strings of the fretboard, they look like this:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/C-Major-Inversions.png" title="C Major triads, all close-voiced inversions on G/B/E" >}}

Notice that when moving up the neck to the next inversion, each "voice" in the triad (lowest, middle, or highest pitch) moves up to the next higher note. The C (root) on the 3rd string moves to E (M3), E moves to G (p5), and G moves to C (root). CEG &rarr; EGC. The same thing going from first to second inversion: EGC &rarr; GCE. And again when repeating the next higher root inversion (at frets 15-17 if you can reach): GCE &rarr; CEG.

These three shapes allow you to play **any** major chord! If you move any of these three shapes two frets higher, it forms D Major (the notes D, F&sharp;, and A).

I recorded this video a while ago. Nothing in it that isn't explained above, but in case it's easier to follow on an actual guitar:

**It's very important to remember where the root note is** in each of these shapes. While accompanying other musicians, you'll often find yourself only thinking about the root notes of each new chord. You'll then find the closest location for that note and form the rest of the shape around it.

If you want to play G major, for example, you can choose between the G at the 12th fret 3rd string, 8th fret of the B string, or 3rd fret of the E string. It's then just a matter of forming the shape appropriate for the root on that string.
