## Major arpeggio shapes

Now that we've looked at major triad shapes in isolation, let's combine them into six-string arpeggios:

{{< figproc "C-Major-Arpeggios" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

I've given each of these three shapes a name: A shape, F shape, and D shape (pronounced "fad" but connected on the neck in AFD, FDA, or DAF order). The names are just so I have something to refer to in the documentation for this course, try not to think about shape names when playing!

For now, use the following exercise to become intimately familiar with these three major arpeggio shapes and how they interconnect.

### CAGED

You've probably heard of the CAGED system which teaches five movable shapes based on the cowboy chords of the same name:

{{< figproc "CAGED-C" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}
{{< figproc "CAGED-A" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}
{{< figproc "CAGED-G" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}
{{< figproc "CAGED-E" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}
{{< figproc "CAGED-D" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

Hopefully you can see how all five of these shapes are included in the three arpeggio shapes of [figure 1](#C-Major-Arpeggios).

### My gripes with CAGED

CAGED has helped an uncountable number of players. There is nothing wrong with teaching CAGED, but to my brain at least it's unnecessarily confusing:

* The A and G shapes share a bunch of notes, as do the C and D shapes. Why name them and think about them as separate shapes?

* Only contortionists can actually play the full D or G shapes &mdash; the fingerings are just too difficult!

  * Most people just play the top four strings or bottom five strings of the G shape.
  * Similarly, most people only play the lower *three* notes in the D shape. That's not even C Major! Technically those three notes only form a C5 power chord since they don't include the third.

* In practice, CAGED tends to over-emphasize root notes on the E and A strings. Countless guitarists that practice CAGED struggle to find notes on anything *other* than the lowest two strings.

* Lastly, with CAGED, I **hated** even thinking things like: "I'm playing an E shape B Major chord." Wait, is it an E or a B? *Way* too confusing.

I find it far simpler to think in terms of the arpeggios in [figure 1](#C-Major-Arpeggios) --- what I'm calling "Rex's FAD".

### Rex's FAD

What follows is one of the **biggest epiphanies I've ever had on the guitar**.

My brain struggled with five CAGED shapes. It became *much* easier when I started focusing on just the top four strings, and reduced CAGED to just the following three triad shapes:

{{< figproc "barre-triads" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

The triad "kernels" of Rex's FAD are shown with solid circles, alternate root locations are shown with hollow circles.

Note where the roots are in each shape (shown in red):

* The 4th string for the F shape (with an alternate on the 1st).

* The 3rd string for the A shape.

* The 2nd string for the D shape.

Since Rex's FAD keeps me focused on just the top four strings, it's easy to know which shape I want to use.

I just have to answer: *Where is the root? On which string?*

* First or fourth string: *use the F shape.*

* Second string: *D shape.*

* Third string: *A shape.*

If you **KNOW** [where the notes are on the fretboard]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/notes/finding-notes" >}}) you'll find it *trivial* to **find chord tones anywhere on the fretboard using just those three triads!**

## Fingerings for FAD

The FAD triads shown in [figure 7](#barre-triads) are only for **visualizing** what I want to play. Actual fingerings depend on where my hand is and what I want to accomplish.

In other words, the three triads in [figure 7](#barre-triads) are merely "hooks" or "indexes" into my memory. They are tools to assist with navigation.

99% of the time, I jut play fingerings on the top four strings:

{{< figproc "FAD-fingerings" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}


### A shape fingerings

### D shape Fingerings

### F shape fingering

## Higher and lower shapes

In addition to the solid root note, alternative locations are also shown on different strings with hollow circles. You can find these alternate root locations with simple [octave shapes]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/notes/finding-notes#octave-shapes" >}}).

Most of the time, **you don't need to think aboutthe lower strings** &mdash; the solid triad shapes are all you need to "see" in your mind's eye. Once you see the triad shape, navigating to the alternate root locations is easy. *Focus primarily on the root note in each triad.*

The E and A strings are mostly for occasional descending runs, usually to the root. The [three shapes in Rex's FAD](#barre-triads) let you focus on the sweet notes (roots and chord tones) on the top four strings.

### Why I like Rex's FAD

The value of "Rex's FAD" to me is:

* I only need to **KNOW** three things rather than five.

* I only have to remember where the *one* root is in each triad kernel (in the middle unless it's F).

* I mastered finding notes on the fretboard, so its now trivial to find chords anywhere on the neck. You have learned your [note locations]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/notes/finding-notes" >}}) haven't you?

* I no longer think about shape names at all. I'd just call those chords [figure 4](#barre-triads) F&sharp;, B, and E and be done with it.

* I can play two of the shapes two different ways, depending on whether I have fingers above or below the "kernel" triad. (The F shape is only played one way.)
