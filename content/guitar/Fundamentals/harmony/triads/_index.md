As we discussed, chords are just multiple notes played simultaneously. Technically, you could have [two-note chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(music)), but most people consider three-note chords ([triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_(music))) to be the simplest possible place to start making useful harmony.

If notes are the atoms, triads form the molecules of western harmony.

This is a very old video on triads that I really need to re-record:

### Diatonic triads

While technically a triad can be formed with any three arbitrary notes, diatonic harmony is based on triads formed from *stacked thirds*: notes that are either a major third or a minor third apart from each other in a diatonic scale.

To make a C Major triad, for example, you would play the notes C, E, and G simultaneously (skipping over D and F from the major scale).

Since there are two stacked intervals, and each interval can be either a Major 3rd (M3) or a minor 3rd (m3) there are logically four types of triads:

Major
: root + M3 + p5 (a major 3rd between the first two notes, and a minor 3rd interval between the next two)

Minor
: root + m3 + p5 (a minor 3rd between the first two notes, and a major 3rd between the next two)

Diminished
: root + m3 + &flat;5 (two minor third intervals stacked on top of each other)

Augmented
: root + M3 + &sharp;5 (two major third intervals stacked on top of each other)

The first two (major and minor triads) are *by far* the most common and useful for playing songs.

### Even big chords can be broken into triads

Harmonic theory doesn't end with triads. Triads are two stacked thirds. If we continue stacking thirds on top, we get 7th chords (three stacked thirds), 9th chords (four stacked thirds), 11th chords (five stacked thirds), and even 13th chords (which contain all seven notes in the diatonic scale!).

*Any* of these larger chords can be reduced to combinations of simple triads.

If you played a Gmaj triad (G/B/D) at the same time someone else played a Bdim  triad (BDF), for example, together you would make the sound of a G7 chord (G/B/D/F).

For some reason, this is rarely discussed, but *you never **need** to play anything other than triads when accompanying other musicians*, no matter how complex the harmony!
