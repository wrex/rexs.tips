As we discussed, chords are just multiple notes played simultaneously. Technically, you could have [two-note chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(music)), but most people consider three-note chords ([triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_(music))) to be the simplest possible place to start making useful harmony.

If notes are the atoms, triads form the molecules of western harmony.
