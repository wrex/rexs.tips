### Minor gripes about CAGED

You've probably heard of the CAGED system which teaches five movable shapes based on the cowboy chord shapes of the same name.

While there is nothing wrong with CAGED, and it's helped an uncountable number of players, to my brain at least it's unnecessarily confusing. The A and G shapes are kinda the same, as are the C and D shapes. Why name them and think about them as separate shapes?

Thinking in CAGED tends to over-emphasize root notes on the E and A strings. It's **extremely** important to be able to "see" roots on the top four strings, especially when you are soloing or comping in a higher register (like you should be in a band situation).

Countless guitarists struggle to find notes on the inner strings.

With CAGED, I **hated** even thinking things like: "I'm playing an E shape B Major chord." Wait, is it an E or a B? *Way* too confusing.

Another thing that annoyed me about CAGED: almost nobody actually plays the full D or G shapes &mdash; the fingerings are just too difficult.

I found it simpler to think in terms of what I'm calling "Rex's FAD".

### Rex's FAD

What follows is one of the **biggest epiphanies I've ever had on the guitar**.

My brain struggled with five CAGED shapes. It became *much* easier when I started focusing on just the top four strings, and reduced CAGED to just the following three triad shapes:

{{< figproc "barre-triads" "Resize" "800x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}

The triad "kernels" of Rex's FAD are shown with filled-in circles.

I have to call the shapes *something* on this page for it to make any sense, so I'll call them the F shape, A shape, and D shape, but **I don't think about these names at all when I'm playing**.

I think about the chord I want to play, and the shape I'm going to put my fingers in to play it, but I completely *ignore the name of the shape* when playing.

Note where the roots are in each shape (shown in red):

* The 4th string for the F shape (and the 1st).

* The 3rd string for the A shape.

* The 2nd string for the D shape.

Since Rex's FAD keeps me focused on just the top four strings, it's easy to know which shape I want to use. **Where is the root?** First string: F shape, 2nd string: D shape, 3rd string: A shape, 4th string: F shape.

If you know [where the notes are on the fretboard]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/notes/finding-notes" >}}) you'll find it easy to form any major chord all over the fretboard just using these three shapes.

## Higher and lower shapes

In addition to the solid root note, alternative locations are also shown on different strings with hollow circles. You can find these alternate root locations with simple [octave shapes]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/notes/finding-notes#octave-shapes" >}}).

Most of the time, **you don't need to think aboutthe lower strings** &mdash; the solid triad shapes are all you need to "see" in your mind's eye. Once you see the triad shape, navigating to the alternate root locations is easy. *Focus primarily on the root note in each triad.*

The E and A strings are mostly for occasional descending runs, usually to the root. The [three shapes in Rex's FAD](#barre-triads) let you focus on the sweet notes (roots and chord tones) on the top four strings.

### Why I like Rex's FAD

The value of "Rex's FAD" to me is:

* I only need to **KNOW** three things rather than five.

* I only have to remember where the *one* root is in each triad kernel (in the middle unless it's F).

* I mastered finding notes on the fretboard, so its now trivial to find chords anywhere on the neck. You have learned your [note locations]({{< ref "guitar/Fundamentals/notes/finding-notes" >}}) haven't you?

* I no longer think about shape names at all. I'd just call those chords [figure 4](#barre-triads) F&sharp;, B, and E and be done with it.

* I can play two of the shapes two different ways, depending on whether I have fingers above or below the "kernel" triad. (The F shape is only played one way.)
