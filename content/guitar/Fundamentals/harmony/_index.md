Notes played in sequence produce a melody. Notes played simultaneously produce harmony, *if* you choose the notes wisely (otherwise they produce *dissonance*).

Notes that go together well are called *chords*. The simplest of these are the "cowboy chords" everyone learns when first starting out.

Once you've learned some basic open-position chords and can strum along to simple songs, it's time to break them down further and study *triads*.
