Cowboy chords are great, especially for "campfire songs". An awful lot of country and pop music can be played using nothing but major chords in open position.

But if you want to **rock**, or you want to solo, or if you just want to become a more accomplished and jazzier guitarist in general, you're going to have to tackle barre chords sooner or later.

The way to make chord shapes movable is to eliminate open strings. If every note is fretted, then moving a shape up or down the fretboard doesn't change its quality. An A Major at the fifth fret becomes a B Major when moved up two frets. If you know how to play an Em9&flat;5 at the 3rd fret, then moving it up to the 4th fret makes it an  Fm9&flat;5.

The good news is that there are really only three barre chord shapes that you absolutely must learn: the E shape, the A shape, and the C shape.

They are named from the cowboy chord shapes you already learned (hopefully you can "see" the open chord shapes if you visualize the nut in place of the barred notes).

{{< figproc "a-shape-barre" "Resize" "300x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}
{{< figproc "c-shape-barre" "Resize" "300x" >}}{{< /figproc >}}


If you truly **KNOW** these three shapes and how they interrelate, you'll be able to easily and effortlessly play major chords anywhere on the neck, not just in open position.

As usual, let's start with a TDG test to determine when you truly **KNOW** these chords: [TDG003: Beginner barre chords]({{< ref "guitar/tests/beginner-barre" >}}).

You've probably heard of the CAGED system which teaches five movable shapes based on the cowboy chord shapes of the same name. While I don't think there is anything wrong with teaching CAGED, to my brain at least it's unnecessarily confusing. The A and G shapes are kinda the same, as are the C and D shapes. Why learn them as separate shapes?

Worse, thinking in CAGED tends to overemphasize root notes on the 5th and 6th strings. It's **extremely** important to be able to "see" roots on any string.

/* new admonition */
What follows is one of the **biggest epiphanies I've ever had on the guitar**.

My brain struggled with five CAGED shapes. It became *much* easier when I reduced CAGED to just the three triad shapes in the following diagram:

/img/neck-diagrams/barre-triads.png" caption="Rex's CAGED: Three Triads"

The triad "kernels" of Rex's CAGED are shown with filled-in circles. Note how the root is **always in the middle** of each triad shape (the roots are shown in red). If you know [where the notes are on the fretboard](#TODO) you'll find it easy to form any major chord all over the fretboard just using these three shapes.

In addition to the solid root note in the middle of each triad, two alternative locations for the root on different strings are also shown. You can find these alternate root locations with simple octave shapes.

**You don't need to think about these alternate root locations** &mdash; the solid triad shapes are all you need to "see" in your mind's eye. Once you see the triad shape, navigating to the alternate root locations is easy. *Focus primarily on the root note in the center of each triad.*

The regular CAGED system wants you to think about, say, D Major as an A shape barre chord with the root on the 5th fret of the 5th string, or a G shape barre chord with the root on the 10th fret. To me, they both "hang off of" the D triad at the 7th fret.

Similarly, the CAGED C shape D Major chord (what a mouthful!) uses the root on the 5th string, but the D shape D major uses the root on the open 4th string. To my mind, they are both the same thing: D Major with the root on the 3rd fret.

The value of "Rex's CAGED" to me is:

* I only need to **KNOW** three things rather than five.

* It's trivial to **KNOW** where the roots are in each shape (always in the middle!).

* **KNOWING** where the root is lets me find major chords anywhere. You have learned your [note locations](#TODO) haven't you?

* **Most important of all**: I no longer think about shapes and shape names at all. With the fret locations shown in the diagram above, I'd just call those chords F&sharp;, B, and E. If I wanted to highlight the fingering, I'd think/say "F&sharp; with 6th string root," "B with 5th string root," and "E with 2nd string root" (or possibly highlighting roots on different strings depending on context).

With regular CAGED, I **hated** saying or thinking things like: "I'm playing an E shape B Major chord." Wait, is it an E or a B? *Way* too confusing.

One thing to note about fretting CAGED chords: almost nobody can actually play the full D or G shapes &mdash; the fingerings are just too tricky.

In practice, most people play the D shape by leaving out the highest note and just playing a three note power chord on the inner strings: the root on the 4th string, fifth on the 3rd, and a second root on the 2nd string.

The G shape is either played on the lowest 5 strings or on the top 4 strings, muting the unplayed notes.

Again, though, why think about shapes at all? I think it's less confusing to only thing about chords (triads) and name things based on the note name of the root. If I need to get specific about the fingering, usually all I need to add is the fret location (the listener can figure out which string has the root at that fret!).

Lastly, note that it's rarely necessary to play more than three or four strings at a time. You may have noticed that the dreaded F chord you learned in open position is really an abbreviated version of the full 6-string E shape barre chord. It's quite common to only play the top three or four strings, or inner three or four strings with any of these shapes. Playing fewer strings is certainly less tiring, and you can pick and choose whether to emphasize lower or higher pitched notes.

Please let me know if you find this way of thinking about CAGED and barre chords useful.
